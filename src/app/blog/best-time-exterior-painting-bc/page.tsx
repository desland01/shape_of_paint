      <p>
        The best time to paint exterior surfaces in BC is during the dry
        season — roughly May through September. But that answer only gets you
        halfway. You also need the right temperature, the right humidity, and
        a dry window of at least 4 hours for the paint to cure properly.
        Paint in the wrong conditions and your $10,000 project could start
        peeling within a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a month-by-month breakdown, plus the exact weather conditions
        your painter should be checking before rolling a single coat.
      </p>

      <h2>The Ideal Conditions for Exterior Paint</h2>

      <p>
        Every premium exterior paint has a set of application requirements
        printed on the can. Most products need all of the following to cure
        correctly:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature above 10°C for at least 24 hours</strong> after
          application. This includes overnight. If it drops below 10°C before
          the paint cures, the film does not form properly and adhesion
          fails.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature below 30°C.</strong> Extreme heat causes paint
          to dry too fast on the surface while staying wet underneath. That
          creates bubbles and poor adhesion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative humidity below 85%.</strong> High humidity slows
          drying and can cause sagging, streaking, and mildew growth in the
          wet film.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No rain for at least 4 hours</strong> after application.
          Some products need 6 to 8 hours. Rain hitting uncured paint washes
          pigment out and ruins the finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dry surfaces.</strong> No dew, no standing moisture, no
          residual dampness from recent rain. Painting over a wet surface
          traps moisture under the film.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vancouver's Painting Season: Month by Month</h2>

      <h3>January to March: Not Recommended</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs sit between 6°C and 10°C. Overnight lows drop to 1°C
        to 4°C. Rain falls 15 to 20 days per month. Surfaces stay damp for
        days at a time. These months fail nearly every condition for exterior
        painting.
      </p>

      <h3>April: Possible With Caution</h3>

      <p>
        April brings the first stretches of dry weather. Average highs reach
        13°C. But overnight lows still dip to 5°C to 7°C, which is below the
        10°C curing threshold for most paints. If your painter uses a
        low-temperature product rated to 4°C (they exist, but cost more),
        late April can work for protected south-facing walls. Expect 10 to 12
        rain days.
      </p>

      <h3>May to June: Prime Season Begins</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs hit 17°C to 20°C. Overnight lows stay above 10°C most
        nights. Rain drops to 8 to 10 days per month. May and June are ideal
        for booking your project. Painters are busy but not yet at peak
        demand, so pricing and scheduling are usually better than July.
      </p>

      <h3>July to August: Peak Season</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs of 22°C to 24°C. Overnight lows of 14°C to 16°C. Only
        4 to 6 rain days per month. This is the safest window for exterior
        painting in BC. Nearly every day meets the ideal conditions. The
        downside: every painter in Vancouver is booked solid. If you want
        July or August, call in March.
      </p>

      <h3>September: Excellent but Book Early</h3>

      <p>
        September is an underrated month for exterior painting. Average highs
        still reach 18°C to 20°C. Overnight lows hover around 11°C to 13°C.
        Rain starts picking up in the second half, but the first 2 to 3 weeks
        are often beautiful. Smart homeowners book September when July and
        August are full.
      </p>

      <h3>October: Last Chance</h3>

      <p>
        Early October can still work. Highs average 13°C to 15°C. But by
        mid-month, overnight lows drop below 10°C regularly and rain returns
        to 12 to 15 days. If your project is not finished by October 15, there
        is a real risk of weather delays that push into the wet season.
      </p>

      <h3>November to December: Off-Season</h3>

      <p>
        Too cold, too wet, too dark. Even low-temperature paints struggle in
        November and December. Wait for spring and protect your investment.
      </p>

      <h2>Morning Dew Is a Hidden Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Even in July, Vancouver surfaces collect dew overnight. If you touch
        your siding at 7 AM and it feels cool and slightly damp, it has dew
        on it. Painting over dew traps moisture under the film and leads to
        peeling within 6 to 12 months.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional crew knows to wait until surfaces warm up and dry —
        usually 9 to 10 AM on most summer days. They also stop painting by 5
        to 6 PM so the last coat has time to cure before evening moisture
        settles.
      </p>

      <h2>What Happens When You Paint in Bad Conditions</h2>

      <p>
        Here is what goes wrong when someone ignores the weather window:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Painted too cold:</strong> Paint film never fully hardens.
          It stays soft, picks up dirt, and peels off in sheets within 1 to 2
          years.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Painted on wet surfaces:</strong> Moisture gets trapped
          under the film. Bubbles and blisters appear within weeks. The only
          fix is scraping and repainting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rain hit the fresh paint:</strong> Water streaks wash out
          pigment, leaving runs and discoloured patches. The affected sections
          need to be sanded and recoated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Painted in extreme heat:</strong> The surface dries before
          the paint underneath. This creates a skin that wrinkles and
          eventually cracks. South-facing stucco walls in August are the most
          common victim.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Scheduling Tips</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Book in February or March</strong> for a May to September
          project. Good painters fill up fast.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be flexible on start dates.</strong> A week of rain can push
          schedules. Painters who wait for the right conditions are protecting
          your investment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask about weather policies.</strong> Your painter should have
          a clear plan for delays. No work on rainy days. No painting after
          4 PM in September. No exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider spring or fall for better pricing.</strong> May,
          June, and September often have slightly lower rates than peak July
          and August. The weather is almost as good.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        May through September is the safe window for exterior painting in BC.
        July and August are the most reliable months. April and October can
        work with the right products and a flexible schedule. Always check
        temperature, humidity, and the forecast before your crew starts. A
        good painter will never rush a project into bad weather — and neither
        should you.
