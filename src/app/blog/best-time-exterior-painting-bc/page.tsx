      <p>
        The best time to paint exterior surfaces in BC is during the dry
        season — roughly May through September. But that answer only gets you
        halfway. You also need the right temperature, the right humidity, and
        a dry window of at least 4 hours for the paint to cure properly.
        Paint in the wrong conditions and your $10,000 project could start
        peeling within a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a month-by-month breakdown, plus the exact weather conditions
        your painter should be checking before rolling a single coat.
      </p>

      <h2>The Ideal Conditions for Exterior Paint</h2>

      <p>
        The ideal conditions for exterior painting in BC are temperatures
        between 10°C and 30°C, relative humidity below 85%, dry surfaces,
        and no rain for at least 4 hours after application. These five
        conditions must all be met for proper film formation and long-term
        adhesion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every premium exterior paint has a set of application requirements
        printed on the can. Most products need all of the following to cure
        correctly:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature above 10°C for at least 24 hours</strong> after
          application. This includes overnight. If it drops below 10°C before
          the paint cures, the film does not form properly and adhesion
          fails.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temperature below 30°C.</strong> Extreme heat causes paint
          to dry too fast on the surface while staying wet underneath. That
          creates bubbles and poor adhesion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative humidity below 85%.</strong> High humidity slows
          drying and can cause sagging, streaking, and mildew growth in the
          wet film.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No rain for at least 4 hours</strong> after application.
          Some products need 6 to 8 hours. Rain hitting uncured paint washes
          pigment out and ruins the finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dry surfaces.</strong> No dew, no standing moisture, no
          residual dampness from recent rain. Painting over a wet surface
          traps moisture under the film.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Vancouver&apos;s Painting Season: Month by Month</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver&apos;s exterior painting season runs from May through
        September, with July and August offering the most reliable weather.
        April and October are possible with caution and specialized
        products. Shape of Paint schedules all exterior projects within
        this window to ensure proper curing conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>January to March: Not Recommended</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs sit between 6°C and 10°C. Overnight lows drop to 1°C
        to 4°C. Rain falls 15 to 20 days per month. Surfaces stay damp for
        days at a time. These months fail nearly every condition for exterior
        painting.
      </p>

      <h3>April: Possible With Caution</h3>

      <p>
        April brings the first stretches of dry weather. Average highs reach
        13°C. But overnight lows still dip to 5°C to 7°C, which is below the
        10°C curing threshold for most paints. If your painter uses a
        low-temperature product rated to 4°C (they exist, but cost more),
        late April can work for protected south-facing walls. Expect 10 to 12
        rain days.
      </p>

      <h3>May to June: Prime Season Begins</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs hit 17°C to 20°C. Overnight lows stay above 10°C most
        nights. Rain drops to 8 to 10 days per month. May and June are ideal
        for booking your project. Painters are busy but not yet at peak
        demand, so pricing and scheduling are usually better than July.
      </p>

      <h3>July to August: Peak Season</h3>

      <p>
        Average highs of 22°C to 24°C. Overnight lows of 14°C to 16°C. Only
        4 to 6 rain days per month. This is the safest window for exterior
        painting in BC. Nearly every day meets the ideal conditions. The
        downside: every painter in Vancouver is booked solid. If you want
        July or August, call in March.
      </p>

      <h3>September: Excellent but Book Early</h3>

      <p>
        September is an underrated month for exterior painting. Average highs
        still reach 18°C to 20°C. Overnight lows hover around 11°C to 13°C.
        Rain starts picking up in the second half, but the first 2 to 3 weeks
        are often beautiful. Smart homeowners book September when July and
        August are full.
      </p>

      <h3>October: Last Chance</h3>

      <p>
        Early October can still work. Highs average 13°C to 15°C. But by
        mid-month, overnight lows drop below 10°C regularly and rain returns
        to 12 to 15 days. If your project is not finished by October 15, there
        is a real risk of weather delays that push into the wet season.
      </p>

      <h3>November to December: Off-Season</h3>

      <p>
        Too cold, too wet, too dark. Even low-temperature paints struggle in
        November and December. Wait for spring and protect your investment.
      </p>

      <h2>Morning Dew Is a Hidden Problem</h2>

      <p>
        Morning dew on Vancouver home exteriors can trap moisture under
        fresh paint and cause peeling within months. Professional crews
        wait until surfaces warm and dry — typically 9 to 10 AM in summer
        — and stop painting by 5 to 6 PM so the last coat cures before
        evening moisture settles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even in July, Vancouver surfaces collect dew overnight. If you touch
        your siding at 7 AM and it feels cool and slightly damp, it has dew
        on it. Painting over dew traps moisture under the film and leads to
        peeling within 6 to 12 months.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional crew knows to wait until surfaces warm up and dry —
        usually 9 to 10 AM on most summer days. They also stop painting by 5
        to 6 PM so the last coat has time to cure before evening moisture
        settles. According to the National Research Council Canada, moisture
        trapped within the building envelope is one of the leading causes
        of premature coating failure on residential exteriors in coastal BC.
      </p>

      <h2>What Happens When You Paint in Bad Conditions</h2>

      <p>
        Painting in bad conditions causes four common failures: soft films
        from cold application, blistering from trapped moisture, pigment
        washout from rain, and wrinkling from extreme heat. Each one
        requires scraping and repainting the affected area — turning a
        single project into two.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is what goes wrong when someone ignores the weather window:
      </p>

      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table className="w-full border-collapse text-lg">

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Scheduling Tips</h2>

      <p>
        Book your Vancouver exterior painting project in February or March
        for a May to September start date. Good painting crews fill their
        summer calendars early, and flexible scheduling around rain days
        produces a better result than rushing into bad weather.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Book in February or March</strong> for a May to September
          project. Good painters fill up fast.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be flexible on start dates.</strong> A week of rain can push
          schedules. Painters who wait for the right conditions are protecting
          your investment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ask about weather policies.</strong> Your painter should have
          a clear plan for delays. No work on rainy days. No painting after
          4 PM in September. No exceptions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider spring or fall for better pricing.</strong> May,
          June, and September often have slightly lower rates than peak July
          and August. The weather is almost as good.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        The best time to paint a house exterior in BC is May through
        September, with July and August as the safest months. According
        to Environment Canada, Vancouver averages only 4 to 6 rain days
        per month in July and August compared to 15 to 20 days per month
        in winter — making summer the only reliable window for exterior
        coatings.
      </p>

      <p>
        May through September is the safe window for exterior painting in BC.
        July and August are the most reliable months. April and October can
        work with the right products and a flexible schedule. Always check
        temperature, humidity, and the forecast before your crew starts. A
        good painter will never rush a project into bad weather — and neither
        should you.
