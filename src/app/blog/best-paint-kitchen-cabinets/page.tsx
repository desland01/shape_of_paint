      <p>
        Choosing the best paint for kitchen cabinets is the most important decision in any
        cabinet refinishing project. The wrong product chips, yellows, or peels within
        months. The right one gives you a factory-smooth finish that lasts 8 to 12 years.
        This guide covers the top products, primers, sheens, and surface considerations
        for Vancouver homeowners in 2026.
      </p>

      <h2>The Two Best Cabinet Paints in 2026</h2>

      <h3>Benjamin Moore Advance</h3>

      <p>
        Advance is an alkyd-modified waterborne paint. It sprays beautifully, self-levels
        like an oil-based product, and cleans up with water. It is the most popular
        professional cabinet paint in Vancouver for good reason.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Excellent self-levelling eliminates brush and roller marks</li>
        <li>Hard, durable finish once fully cured (14 to 21 days)</li>
        <li>Low odour — safe for occupied homes</li>
        <li>Available in thousands of Benjamin Moore colours</li>
        <li>Easy touch-up if needed down the road</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The main downside is cure time. Advance needs 14 to 21 days to reach full
        hardness. During that period, you need to be gentle with your cabinet doors.
        No slamming. No scrubbing. After it fully cures, it is extremely durable.
      </p>

      <h3>Sherwin-Williams Emerald Urethane Trim Enamel</h3>

      <p>
        Emerald Urethane is a direct competitor to Advance. It offers a urethane-modified
        alkyd formula that sprays well and provides a hard, furniture-grade finish.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Urethane formula creates a harder film than standard waterborne paints</li>
        <li>Excellent adhesion to properly primed surfaces</li>
        <li>Resists yellowing better than oil-based alternatives</li>
        <li>Slightly faster initial dry time than Advance</li>
        <li>Good colour selection through Sherwin-Williams stores</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Both products deliver professional results when spray-applied. The choice often
        comes down to your painter&apos;s preference and which colour system matches your
        design.
      </p>

      <h2>Acrylic Alkyd vs. Standard Latex</h2>

      <p>
        Standard latex wall paint should never go on kitchen cabinets. It stays soft,
        scuffs easily, and peels off slick surfaces. Even premium wall paint like Benjamin
        Moore Regal or Sherwin-Williams Duration is designed for walls, not high-touch
        cabinetry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acrylic alkyd paints (like Advance and Emerald Urethane) combine the easy cleanup
        of latex with the hard finish of traditional oil-based paint. The alkyd resin
        cross-links as it cures, creating a film that is 3 to 4 times harder than
        standard latex. That hardness is what prevents chips, scratches, and wear on
        cabinet doors you touch 20+ times per day.
      </p>

      <h2>Primer Matters More Than You Think</h2>

      <p>
        Primer is the foundation of every cabinet paint job. Skip it and your topcoat
        will fail. Use the wrong one and you get adhesion problems, tannin bleed, or
        chipping within the first year.
      </p>

      <h3>BIN Shellac-Based Primer (Zinsser)</h3>

      <p>
        BIN is the gold standard for cabinet priming. It bonds to virtually any surface,
        blocks tannin bleed from wood and MDF, and dries in 45 minutes. It is the go-to
        primer when converting dark stained cabinets to white or light colours.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bonds to wood, MDF, laminate, and previously finished surfaces</li>
        <li>Blocks tannin bleed that causes yellow spots on white paint</li>
        <li>Dries fast so the project stays on schedule</li>
        <li>Strong odour requires ventilation — best applied off-site in a spray booth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stix Bonding Primer (Insl-x)</h3>

      <p>
        Stix is a waterborne bonding primer that adheres to slick surfaces like laminate,
        glossy finishes, and factory-coated MDF. It has lower odour than BIN, making it
        a good choice for on-site frame priming when spray booth work is not practical.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bonds to glossy and slick surfaces without heavy sanding</li>
        <li>Lower odour than shellac-based primers</li>
        <li>Good choice for on-site cabinet frame priming</li>
        <li>Does not block tannin as well as BIN — not ideal for dark-to-light conversions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sheen Levels for Cabinets</h2>

      <h3>Semi-Gloss</h3>

      <p>
        Semi-gloss is the traditional choice for kitchen cabinets. It reflects light,
        cleans easily, and resists fingerprints and grease. If you want your cabinets to
        look crisp and polished, semi-gloss is the way to go. About 60% of our Vancouver
        cabinet projects use semi-gloss.
      </p>

      <h3>Satin</h3>

      <p>
        Satin has a softer sheen that hides minor surface imperfections. It is popular for
        Shaker-style and transitional kitchens where a matte, modern look is the goal.
        Satin shows fingerprints slightly less than semi-gloss. About 35% of our projects
        use satin.
      </p>

      <h3>Matte</h3>

      <p>
        Matte finishes on cabinets look beautiful on day one and terrible by month six.
        Kitchen grease, fingerprints, and cooking splatter are nearly impossible to clean
        off a matte surface without leaving marks. We do not recommend matte for kitchen
        cabinets under any circumstances.
      </p>

      <h2>MDF vs. Solid Wood Cabinets</h2>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver kitchens built since 1990 use MDF doors or a combination of MDF
        panels with solid wood frames. Both paint well, but the prep differs.
      </p>

      <p>
        MDF absorbs primer differently than wood. The edges are especially porous and need
        extra primer to seal properly. Without proper sealing, MDF edges swell when
        exposed to moisture from cooking or dishwasher steam.
      </p>

      <p>
        Solid wood can have grain that telegraphs through paint. A grain-filling primer
        or an extra coat of BIN helps smooth the surface before topcoat. Wood also expands
        and contracts with seasonal humidity changes, which is why flexible acrylic alkyd
        paints outperform rigid oil-based paints in Vancouver&apos;s damp climate.
      </p>

      <h2>Colour Trends in Vancouver for 2026</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>White remains the top choice (BM Simply White, SW Extra White)</li>
        <li>Warm whites are gaining ground (BM White Dove, SW Alabaster)</li>
        <li>Navy and dark green for bold island accents</li>
        <li>Sage green and muted olive for transitional kitchens</li>
        <li>Two-tone kitchens with white uppers and a darker lower colour</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Use an acrylic alkyd paint (Benjamin Moore Advance or Sherwin-Williams Emerald
        Urethane), a proper bonding primer (BIN or Stix), and a semi-gloss or satin sheen.
        Skip the standard latex. Skip the matte. And always have your cabinets sprayed,
        not brushed.
