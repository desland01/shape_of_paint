      <p>
        Picking interior paint colours in Vancouver is different from picking colours in
        Phoenix or Miami. You live under grey skies for 8 months of the year. That overcast
        light shifts how every colour looks on your walls. A shade that looks warm and inviting
        at the paint store can look flat and cold in your living room on a rainy Tuesday in
        November.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide helps you choose colours that actually work in Vancouver light. You will
        learn what undertones to look for, which trending colours hold up, and how to test
        before you commit to a full room.
      </p>

      <h2>How Vancouver Light Affects Paint Colour</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver receives an average of just 1,938 hours of sunshine per year, which means overcast skies dominate for roughly 8 months. According to Environment Canada, Vancouver ranks among the cloudiest major cities in the country. That cool, diffused light pulls warm undertones out of paint and pushes cool undertones forward, making colour selection critical for any interior painting project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Natural light in Vancouver skews cool and blue-grey for most of the year. That cool
        light pulls warm undertones out of a colour and pushes cool undertones forward. A
        greige that looks perfectly balanced in direct sunlight can lean purple or blue under
        overcast skies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fix is simple. Choose colours with warm undertones. Creamy whites, warm greys
        with yellow or pink bases, and earth tones all perform well here. Cool blues and stark
        whites tend to feel sterile when the sky outside is already grey.
      </p>

      <p>
        South-facing rooms get the most natural light and can handle cooler colours. North-
        facing rooms get almost no direct sun. In those rooms, go warmer than you think you
        need to.
      </p>

      <h2>Trending Colours for 2026</h2>

      <p>
        The most popular interior paint colours in Vancouver for 2026 are warm whites, earthy greens, warm neutrals, and moody navy accents. Shape of Paint colour consultations consistently recommend shades with warm undertones that hold up under the city's overcast light conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Warm Whites</h3>

      <p>
        Warm whites are the safest and most popular choice for Vancouver homes right now.
        Benjamin Moore White Dove (OC-17) and Sherwin-Williams Alabaster (SW 7008) are two
        of the most requested shades. They read as clean and bright without the clinical feel
        of a true white. These work in every room and pair well with any trim colour.
      </p>

      <h3>Earthy Greens</h3>

      <p>
        Sage and olive tones are everywhere in 2026. They connect your interior to the lush
        greenery outside your window. Benjamin Moore Saybrook Sage (HC-114) and Sherwin-
        Williams Evergreen Fog (SW 9130) add depth without feeling dark. Use them in bedrooms,
        powder rooms, or as an accent in open-concept living spaces.
      </p>

      <h3>Warm Neutrals</h3>

      <p>
        Beige is back, but smarter. The new warm neutrals have complex undertones that shift
        beautifully between daylight and artificial light. Benjamin Moore Revere Pewter (HC-172)
        remains a Vancouver staple. For something slightly warmer, try Balboa Mist (OC-27).
        These colours make a room feel grounded without committing to a bold statement.
      </p>

      <h3>Moody Blues and Navies</h3>

      <p>
        Dark accent walls are still going strong. Hale Navy (HC-154) by Benjamin Moore and
        Naval (SW 6244) by Sherwin-Williams create dramatic contrast in a room with enough
        natural light. Use them on a single wall or in a den. Pair with warm white trim for
        balance.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Test Colours Properly</h2>

      <p>
        Testing paint colours in your actual room is the single most important step in choosing the right shade. A 2-foot by 2-foot sample patch viewed at three different times of day reveals how Vancouver's shifting light changes the colour from morning grey to afternoon warmth to evening lamp light.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never choose a paint colour from a 1-inch chip. Here is the right way to test:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Buy sample pots or peel-and-stick swatches in your top 3 choices.</li>
        <li>Paint a 2-foot by 2-foot patch on at least two walls in the room. Pick one wall
        that gets light and one that does not.</li>
        <li>Look at the samples at different times of day: morning, afternoon, and evening
        with the lights on.</li>
        <li>Live with them for at least 48 hours. Your first impression is usually wrong.</li>
        <li>Check the colour against your existing flooring, furniture, and countertops.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Large-format peel-and-stick swatches from Benjamin Moore and Sherwin-Williams cost $5
        to $8 each. That is a tiny investment compared to repainting a room because the colour
        looked different at home than it did in the store. At Shape of Paint, we bring fan
        decks and large swatches to every colour consultation. We tape them to your walls,
        check them in morning and afternoon light, and make sure you are 100% confident
        before we open a single can.
      </p>

      <h2>Coordinating Trim, Walls, and Ceilings</h2>

      <p>
        Coordinating trim, walls, and ceiling colours creates a cohesive interior that feels intentional rather than piecemeal. Shape of Paint specifies the exact sheen for each surface — flat for ceilings, eggshell for walls, semi-gloss for trim — so every element works together in Vancouver's natural light.
      </p>

      <p>
        A common mistake is choosing a wall colour and ignoring everything else. Your trim,
        ceilings, and walls need to work together. We spec the exact sheen for each surface:
        flat for ceilings, eggshell for walls, semi-gloss for trim and doors. That combination
        gives you the right look and the right durability in every spot.
      </p>

      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table className="w-full border-collapse text-lg">
          <thead>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">

          <tbody className="text-text-secondary">

              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Trim</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">White or off-white sharing the same undertone family as wall colour</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Ceilings</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Flat white one shade lighter than walls (makes ceiling feel higher)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Doors</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Match trim colour for clean look, or bold contrast (test first)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>Open Concept Colour Flow</h2>

      <p>
        Open-concept Vancouver condos and modern homes need one main colour for shared living spaces, with accent colours reserved for closed rooms like bedrooms and bathrooms. This creates visual flow across the floor plan instead of the choppy, disjointed look that comes from painting each zone a different shade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vancouver condos and modern homes often have open floor plans where the kitchen,
        living room, and dining area share one continuous space. Painting each zone a
        different colour creates visual chaos.
      </p>

      <p>
        The better approach is to pick one main colour for the shared space and use accent
        colours in separate rooms like bedrooms and bathrooms. If you want variety in the
        open area, vary the sheen. Use eggshell on walls and semi-gloss on trim. The
        different reflections create subtle depth without clashing colours.
      </p>

      <p>
        For hallways and transition spaces, stick with your main colour. This creates a
        through-line that ties the whole home together.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Colour Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

      <p>
        The five most common interior paint colour mistakes Vancouver homeowners make are choosing under store lighting, ignoring undertones, going too bold too fast, forgetting fixed finishes, and skipping primer on colour changes. Avoiding these mistakes saves time, money, and the frustration of a repaint.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Choosing colours under store lighting. Fluorescent lights distort every colour.
        Always test at home.</li>
        <li>Ignoring undertones. Every grey has an undertone: blue, green, purple, or pink.
        That undertone becomes the dominant colour under Vancouver skies.</li>
        <li>Going too bold too fast. Paint your boldest colour on a single accent wall first.
        If you love it after two weeks, expand from there.</li>
        <li>Forgetting about your fixed finishes. Your countertops, flooring, and tile are
        staying put. Your wall colour needs to complement what is already there.</li>
        <li>Skipping primer on colour changes. Going from dark to light without primer means
        three or four coats instead of two. That costs you time and money. According to Sherwin-Williams, using a quality tinted primer reduces topcoat coverage requirements by up to 50% on dark-to-light colour transitions.</li>
      </ul>
