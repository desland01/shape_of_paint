      <p>
        The interior painting cost per square foot in Vancouver ranges from $3 to $6 for
        walls only. Add ceilings and trim and you are looking at $4 to $8 per square foot. A
        typical 1,500 square foot home costs between $2,000 and $5,000 for a full interior
        repaint. That range reflects the scope of work, the condition of your walls, and the
        calibre of materials your painter uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide breaks down every factor that drives the final number. You will know
        exactly what to expect when you hire a quality interior painter in Vancouver.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Per Square Foot Breakdown</h2>

      <p>
        Here is what professional interior work costs in Vancouver in 2026, broken down by
        scope:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walls only: $3 to $6 per square foot</li>
        <li>Walls plus ceilings: $4 to $7 per square foot</li>
        <li>Walls, ceilings, and trim: $4 to $8 per square foot</li>
        <li>Single accent wall: $200 to $500 depending on size and prep</li>
        <li>Full room (walls, ceiling, trim, door): $600 to $1,800</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The lower end of each range assumes standard 8-foot ceilings, walls in good
        condition, and a mid-grade paint. The higher end reflects premium paint, tall ceilings,
        older walls that need thorough prep, or detailed trim work. Most of the projects we
        take on at Shape of Paint land in the upper half of these ranges because our clients
        expect a finish that holds up and looks right for years.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives the Price of Quality Interior Work</h2>

      <h3>Scope and Number of Rooms</h3>

      <p>
        A whole-home project is more efficient than a single room. The crew already has
        equipment set up, drop cloths down, and materials on-site. Adding a second bedroom to
        the scope costs less per room than painting it as a standalone project. Whole-home
        projects also produce a more cohesive result because the same crew controls colour
        transitions, sheen consistency, and finish quality from room to room.
      </p>

      <h3>Ceiling Height</h3>

      <p>
        Standard 8-foot ceilings are straightforward. Once you hit 9 or 10 feet, the crew
        needs step ladders for every cut-in line. Vaulted ceilings and two-storey foyers
        require scaffolding or extension poles. That adds time and equipment costs. Expect a
        15% to 25% premium on rooms over 9 feet.
      </p>

      <h3>Wall Condition and Prep Work</h3>

      <p>
        This is where most surprises happen. Walls with nail pops, drywall patches, cracks,
        or peeling paint need repair before a single drop of colour goes on. Minor patching
        is usually included in a professional quote. But if your walls need skim coating or
        extensive drywall repair, that adds $1 to $3 per square foot to the project. Proper
        prep is non-negotiable if you want a finish that looks clean under natural light and
        lasts a decade.
      </p>

      <h3>Paint Quality</h3>

      <p>
        Contractor-grade paint costs $30 to $40 per gallon. Premium lines like Benjamin Moore
        Regal or Sherwin-Williams Emerald run $60 to $85 per gallon. The difference is
        obvious: richer colour depth, smoother application, and a finish that still looks fresh
        after 8 to 12 years instead of fading and wearing at 4 to 6. Premium paint also covers
        in fewer coats, which means less buildup and cleaner lines on trim and edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most homeowners investing in professional interior work, premium paint is the
        logical choice. You are already paying for skilled labour and thorough prep. Putting a
        top-tier product on the wall is the difference between a result that looks professional
        and one that looks exceptional.
      </p>

      <h3>Trim, Doors, and Baseboards</h3>

      <p>
        Painting trim is slower than painting walls. A painter uses a brush for every linear
        foot. It takes precision and patience. Trim painting adds $1 to $3 per linear foot.
        Doors add $75 to $150 each. Baseboards run $1 to $2 per linear foot. Fresh walls
        next to tired, dingy trim is one of the most common mistakes homeowners make. If
        you are repainting your walls, your trim deserves the same attention.
      </p>

      <h2>Average Project Costs in Vancouver</h2>

      <p>
        Here is what Vancouver homeowners typically invest in quality interior painting in
        2026:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>1-bedroom condo (700 sq ft): $1,200 to $2,500</li>
        <li>2-bedroom apartment (900 sq ft): $1,800 to $3,500</li>
        <li>3-bedroom house (1,500 sq ft): $2,500 to $5,000</li>
        <li>4-bedroom house (2,200 sq ft): $3,500 to $7,000</li>
        <li>Large home (3,000+ sq ft): $5,000 to $12,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These ranges include thorough prep, two coats of quality paint on walls, and basic
        trim touch-ups. They do not include major drywall repair, wallpaper removal, or
        specialty finishes like Venetian plaster or limewash.
      </p>

      <h2>What a Professional Quote Should Include</h2>

      <p>
        A detailed quote from a reputable Vancouver painting contractor covers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Surface preparation: patching small holes, sanding, cleaning, taping</li>
        <li>Primer where needed (new drywall, dark-to-light colour changes, stains)</li>
        <li>Two coats of paint on all specified surfaces</li>
        <li>Protection of floors, furniture, and fixtures with drop cloths</li>
        <li>Cleanup and removal of all materials when the job is done</li>
        <li>A workmanship warranty (look for at least 2 years)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a quote does not mention prep work or the number of coats, ask. A suspiciously
        low quote usually signals corners being cut — one thin coat, no primer, and prep work
        skipped entirely. That kind of job peels within a year.
      </p>

      <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Professional</h2>

      <p>
        Doing it yourself costs about 70% less in dollar terms. A gallon of paint and some
        rollers might run you $300 to $600 for a room. But you spend 15 to 25 hours on a
        single bedroom when you include prep, cutting in, two coats, and cleanup.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional crew finishes that same room in 4 to 6 hours. The edges are cleaner.
        The finish is more even. And you do not spend your weekend on a ladder with a sore
        neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIY makes sense for a single accent wall or a small closet. For a full home or
        anything with detailed trim, the professional result is the one you will actually
        be happy looking at for the next decade. You also avoid buying rollers, trays, tape,
        brushes, drop cloths, and a ladder you will use once.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get the Most From Your Investment</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Get three quotes. Compare scope, materials, and warranty — not just the bottom
        line number.</li>
        <li>Ask about paint brands. A contractor who specifies Benjamin Moore or
        Sherwin-Williams by name is committed to a proven product.</li>
        <li>Paint the whole home at once when possible. A single mobilization produces a more
        consistent result and better per-room value than piecemeal projects over several
        years.</li>
        <li>Book early in the year. January through March is quieter for interior painters,
        and you will have more flexibility on scheduling.</li>
        <li>Clear rooms before the crew arrives. Moving furniture, taking down art, and
        covering anything you want protected gives your painters unobstructed access to
        every surface — and that translates directly into cleaner lines and faster
        turnaround.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Every home is different. Square footage gives you a starting point, but the real
        price depends on your specific walls, ceilings, and trim. The most reliable way to
        get an accurate number is to have a painter walk through your space and give you a
        written estimate with materials and scope spelled out.
