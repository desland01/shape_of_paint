      <p>
        The interior painting cost per square foot in Vancouver ranges from $3 to $6 for
        walls only. Add ceilings and trim and you are looking at $4 to $8 per square foot. A
        typical 1,500 square foot home costs between $2,000 and $5,000 for a full interior
        repaint. That range depends on how many rooms you are painting, the condition of your
        walls, and the quality of paint you choose.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide breaks down every factor that affects your final price. You will know
        exactly what to budget before you call a painter.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Per Square Foot Breakdown</h2>

      <p>
        Here is what Vancouver painting contractors typically charge in 2026:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walls only: $3 to $6 per square foot</li>
        <li>Walls plus ceilings: $4 to $7 per square foot</li>
        <li>Walls, ceilings, and trim: $4 to $8 per square foot</li>
        <li>Single accent wall: $200 to $500 depending on size and prep</li>
        <li>Full room (walls, ceiling, trim, door): $600 to $1,800</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The lower end of each range assumes standard 8-foot ceilings, walls in good
        condition, and basic contractor-grade paint. The higher end includes premium paint,
        tall ceilings, older walls that need extra prep, or detailed trim work.
      </p>

      <h2>What Affects Your Price</h2>

      <h3>Number of Rooms</h3>

      <p>
        More rooms means a lower per-room cost. A painter already has their equipment set up,
        drop cloths down, and materials on-site. Adding a second bedroom to the scope costs
        less than painting that room on its own. Most painters give a discount when you book
        five or more rooms at once.
      </p>

      <h3>Ceiling Height</h3>

      <p>
        Standard 8-foot ceilings are straightforward. Once you hit 9 or 10 feet, the crew
        needs step ladders for every cut-in line. Vaulted ceilings and two-storey foyers
        require scaffolding or extension poles. That adds time and equipment costs. Expect a
        15% to 25% premium on rooms over 9 feet.
      </p>

      <h3>Wall Condition and Prep Work</h3>

      <p>
        This is where most surprises happen. Walls with nail pops, drywall patches, cracks,
        or peeling paint need repair before a single drop of colour goes on. Minor patching
        is usually included in a professional quote. But if your walls need skim coating or
        extensive drywall repair, that adds $1 to $3 per square foot to the project.
      </p>

      <h3>Paint Quality</h3>

      <p>
        Contractor-grade paint costs $30 to $40 per gallon. Premium lines like Benjamin Moore
        Regal or Sherwin-Williams Emerald run $60 to $85 per gallon. The difference shows up
        in coverage, durability, and how the colour looks in different light. Premium paint
        needs fewer coats, covers better, and lasts 8 to 12 years instead of 4 to 6.
      </p>

      <h3>Trim, Doors, and Baseboards</h3>

      <p>
        Painting trim is slower than painting walls. A painter uses a brush for every linear
        foot. It takes precision and patience. Trim painting adds $1 to $3 per linear foot.
        Doors add $75 to $150 each. Baseboards run $1 to $2 per linear foot. If you skip
        trim, your fresh walls will make the old trim look dingy by comparison.
      </p>

      <h2>Average Project Costs in Vancouver</h2>

      <p>
        Here is what real Vancouver homeowners pay in 2026:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>1-bedroom condo (700 sq ft): $1,200 to $2,500</li>
        <li>2-bedroom apartment (900 sq ft): $1,800 to $3,500</li>
        <li>3-bedroom house (1,500 sq ft): $2,500 to $5,000</li>
        <li>4-bedroom house (2,200 sq ft): $3,500 to $7,000</li>
        <li>Large home (3,000+ sq ft): $5,000 to $12,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These ranges include standard prep, two coats of quality paint on walls, and basic
        trim touch-ups. They do not include major drywall repair, wallpaper removal, or
        specialty finishes.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Included in a Professional Quote</h2>

      <p>
        A good painting quote from a reputable Vancouver contractor should cover:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Surface preparation: patching small holes, sanding, cleaning, taping</li>
        <li>Primer where needed (new drywall, dark-to-light colour changes, stains)</li>
        <li>Two coats of paint on all specified surfaces</li>
        <li>Protection of floors, furniture, and fixtures with drop cloths</li>
        <li>Cleanup and removal of all materials when the job is done</li>
        <li>A workmanship warranty (look for at least 2 years)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a quote does not mention prep work or the number of coats, ask. The cheapest
        quote often means one thin coat and no prep. That peels within a year.
      </p>

      <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Professional</h2>

      <p>
        Doing it yourself costs about 70% less in dollar terms. A gallon of paint and some
        rollers might run you $300 to $600 for a room. But you spend 15 to 25 hours on a
        single bedroom when you include prep, cutting in, two coats, and cleanup.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional crew finishes that same room in 4 to 6 hours. The edges are cleaner.
        The finish is more even. And you do not spend your weekend on a ladder with a sore
        neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIY makes sense for a single accent wall or a small closet. For a full home or
        anything with detailed trim, the professional result is worth the investment. You
        also avoid buying rollers, trays, tape, brushes, drop cloths, and a ladder you will
        use once.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get the Best Value</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Get three quotes. Compare what each includes, not just the bottom line.</li>
        <li>Ask about paint brands. A pro who uses Benjamin Moore or Sherwin-Williams is using
        proven products.</li>
        <li>Bundle rooms. The more you paint at once, the lower your per-room cost.</li>
        <li>Schedule in the off-season. January through March is slower for painters. You may
        find better availability and pricing.</li>
        <li>Do your own furniture moving. Clearing rooms before the crew arrives saves them
        time and can reduce your quote by 5% to 10%.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Get a Quote for Your Home</h2>

      <p>
        Every home is different. Square footage gives you a ballpark, but the real price
        depends on your specific walls, ceilings, and trim. The fastest way to get an
        accurate number is to have a painter walk through your space and give you a written
        estimate.
