      <p>
        The interior painting cost per square foot in Vancouver ranges from $3 to $6 for
        walls only. Add ceilings and trim and you are looking at $4 to $8 per square foot. A
        typical 1,500 square foot home costs between $2,000 and $5,000 for a full interior
        repaint. That range reflects the scope of work, the condition of your walls, and the
        calibre of materials your painter uses.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide breaks down every factor that drives the final number. You will know
        exactly what to expect when you hire a quality interior painter in Vancouver.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Per Square Foot Breakdown</h2>

      <p>
        Interior painting in Vancouver costs $3 to $8 per square foot in 2026, depending on whether the scope includes walls only, walls and ceilings, or walls, ceilings, and trim. Shape of Paint provides transparent per-square-foot pricing so Vancouver homeowners know exactly what each surface costs before the project starts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is what professional interior work costs in Vancouver in 2026, broken down by
        scope:
      </p>

      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table className="w-full border-collapse text-lg">
          <thead>

              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Cost Per Sq Ft</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody className="text-text-secondary">
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Walls only</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$3 to $6</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Walls plus ceilings</td>

              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Walls, ceilings, and trim</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$4 to $8</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Single accent wall</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$200 to $500</td>
            </tr>

              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Full room (walls, ceiling, trim, door)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$600 to $1,800</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        The lower end of each range assumes standard 8-foot ceilings, walls in good
        condition, and a mid-grade paint. The higher end reflects premium paint, tall ceilings,
        older walls that need thorough prep, or detailed trim work. Most of the projects we
        take on at Shape of Paint land in the upper half of these ranges because our clients
        expect a finish that holds up and looks right for years.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives the Price of Quality Interior Work</h2>

      <p>
        The biggest factors affecting interior painting cost in Vancouver are scope, ceiling height, wall condition, paint quality, and trim complexity. Each factor can shift the final price by 15% to 40%, which is why no two projects cost the same.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope and Number of Rooms</h3>

      <p>
        A whole-home project is more efficient than a single room. The crew already has
        equipment set up, drop cloths down, and materials on-site. Adding a second bedroom to
        the scope costs less per room than painting it as a standalone project. Whole-home
        projects also produce a more consistent result because the same crew controls colour
        transitions, sheen consistency, and finish quality from room to room.
      </p>

      <h3>Ceiling Height</h3>

      <p>
        Standard 8-foot ceilings are straightforward. Once you hit 9 or 10 feet, the crew
        needs step ladders for every cut-in line. Vaulted ceilings and two-storey foyers
        require scaffolding or extension poles. That adds time and equipment costs. Expect a
        15% to 25% premium on rooms over 9 feet.
      </p>

      <h3>Wall Condition and Prep Work</h3>

      <p>
        This is where most surprises happen. Walls with nail pops, drywall patches, cracks,
        or peeling paint need repair before a single drop of colour goes on. Minor patching
        is usually included in a professional quote. But if your walls need skim coating or
        extensive drywall repair, that adds $1 to $3 per square foot to the project. At
        Shape of Paint, we sand every surface to 150 grit, fill nail holes with lightweight
        spackle, and prime with Zinsser 1-2-3 before any colour goes on. That prep work is
        what separates a 3-year paint job from a 10-year one.
      </p>

      <h3>Paint Quality</h3>

      <p>
        Contractor-grade paint costs $30 to $40 per gallon. Premium lines like Benjamin Moore
        Regal or Sherwin-Williams Emerald run $60 to $85 per gallon. The difference is
        obvious: richer colour depth, smoother application, and a finish that still looks fresh
        after 8 to 12 years instead of fading and wearing at 4 to 6. According to Benjamin Moore, their Regal Select line delivers up to 25% better hide than standard formulas, which means fewer coats and a more uniform finish. Premium paint also covers
        in fewer coats, which means less buildup and cleaner lines on trim and edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        We use Benjamin Moore Regal Select on 90% of our interior projects. It self-levels
        to a smooth finish, covers in two coats, and holds its colour for 8 to 12 years. You
        are already paying for skilled labour and thorough prep. Putting a top-tier product
        on the wall is the difference between a result that looks professional and one that
        looks exceptional.
      </p>

      <h3>Trim, Doors, and Baseboards</h3>

      <p>
        Painting trim is slower than painting walls. A painter uses a brush for every linear
        foot. It takes precision and patience. Trim painting adds $1 to $3 per linear foot.
        Doors add $75 to $150 each. Baseboards run $1 to $2 per linear foot. Fresh walls
        next to tired, dingy trim is one of the most common mistakes homeowners make. If
        you are repainting your walls, your trim deserves the same attention.
      </p>

      <h2>Average Project Costs in Vancouver</h2>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver homeowners invest between $2,500 and $7,000 for a professional interior repaint in 2026. The final number depends on square footage, wall condition, and whether trim and ceilings are included. According to HomeStars, the average interior painting project in Metro Vancouver ranges from $2,800 to $6,500 based on contractor pricing survey data from 2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is what Vancouver homeowners typically invest in quality interior painting in
        2026:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>1-bedroom condo (700 sq ft): $1,200 to $2,500</li>
        <li>2-bedroom apartment (900 sq ft): $1,800 to $3,500</li>
        <li>3-bedroom house (1,500 sq ft): $2,500 to $5,000</li>
        <li>4-bedroom house (2,200 sq ft): $3,500 to $7,000</li>
        <li>Large home (3,000+ sq ft): $5,000 to $12,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These ranges include thorough prep, two coats of quality paint on walls, and basic
        trim touch-ups. They do not include major drywall repair, wallpaper removal, or
        specialty finishes like Venetian plaster or limewash.
      </p>

      <h2>What a Professional Quote Should Include</h2>

      <p>
        A professional interior painting quote in Vancouver should itemize surface preparation, primer, coats of paint, protection, cleanup, and warranty. Shape of Paint includes all six elements in every written estimate so homeowners can compare quotes on equal terms.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Surface preparation: patching with DAP DryDex spackle, sanding to 150 grit, cleaning walls with TSP solution, masking edges with FrogTape</li>
        <li>Primer where needed: Zinsser 1-2-3 for new drywall, BIN shellac primer for water stains, tinted primer for dark-to-light colour changes</li>
        <li>Two coats of paint on all specified surfaces</li>
        <li>Protection of floors, furniture, and fixtures with drop cloths</li>
        <li>Cleanup and removal of all materials when the job is done</li>
        <li>A workmanship warranty (look for at least 2 years)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If a quote does not mention prep work or the number of coats, ask. A suspiciously
        low quote usually signals corners being cut — one thin coat, no primer, and prep work
        skipped entirely. That kind of job peels within a year.
      </p>

      <h2>DIY vs. Hiring a Professional</h2>

      <p>
        DIY interior painting costs about 70% less in materials but takes 3 to 5 times longer than hiring a professional crew. For a single accent wall, doing it yourself makes sense. For a full home in Vancouver, the professional result pays for itself in time saved and a finish that lasts years longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing it yourself costs about 70% less in dollar terms. A gallon of paint and some
        rollers might run you $300 to $600 for a room. But you spend 15 to 25 hours on a
        single bedroom when you include prep, cutting in, two coats, and cleanup.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional crew finishes that same room in 4 to 6 hours. The edges are cleaner.
        The finish is more even. And you do not spend your weekend on a ladder with a sore
        neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        DIY makes sense for a single accent wall or a small closet. For a full home or
        anything with detailed trim, the professional result is the one you will actually
        be happy looking at for the next decade. You also avoid buying rollers, trays, tape,
        brushes, drop cloths, and a ladder you will use once.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get the Most From Your Investment</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver homeowners get the best value from their interior painting investment by comparing quotes on scope and materials, choosing premium paint, and booking during the quieter winter months. These five steps help you maximize every dollar spent on your project.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Get three quotes. Compare scope, materials, and warranty — not just the bottom
        line number.</li>
        <li>Ask about paint brands. A contractor who specifies Benjamin Moore or
        Sherwin-Williams by name is committed to a proven product.</li>
        <li>Paint the whole home at once when possible. A single mobilization produces a more
        consistent result and better per-room value than piecemeal projects over several
        years.</li>
        <li>Book early in the year. January through March is quieter for interior painters,
        and you will have more flexibility on scheduling.</li>
        <li>Clear rooms before the crew arrives. Moving furniture, taking down art, and
        covering anything you want protected gives your painters unobstructed access to
        every surface — and that translates directly into cleaner lines and faster
        turnaround.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Get a Quote for Your Home</h2>

      <p>
        Shape of Paint provides detailed written estimates for every interior painting project in Vancouver. Our quotes include square footage pricing, material specifications, prep scope, and a workmanship warranty so you know exactly what you are paying for before the crew arrives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every home is different. Square footage gives you a starting point, but the real
        price depends on your specific walls, ceilings, and trim. The most reliable way to
        get an accurate number is to have a painter walk through your space and give you a
        written estimate with materials and scope spelled out. We take on 4 to 5 interior
        projects per month so we can give each home the time it deserves.
