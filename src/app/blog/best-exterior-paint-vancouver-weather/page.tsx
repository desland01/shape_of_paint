      <p>
        Choosing the best exterior paint for Vancouver weather is not the same
        as choosing paint for a dry climate. Vancouver gets roughly 1,200 mm of
        rain per year. Humidity hovers between 70% and 90% for months at a
        time. Mildew grows on north-facing walls like it is paying rent. If you
        pick the wrong product, your fresh paint job will look tired within 2
        to 3 years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is what actually works on Vancouver homes — based on thousands of
        projects across the Lower Mainland, not just the label on the can.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Vancouver Is Hard on Exterior Paint</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver is hard on exterior paint because of persistent rain,
        year-round mildew growth, and intense summer UV exposure. According
        to Environment Canada, Vancouver receives approximately 166 rain
        days per year and 1,189 mm of total rainfall, making moisture
        resistance the single most important factor in exterior coating
        selection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three things destroy exterior paint faster in Vancouver than almost
        anywhere else in Canada.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent moisture.</strong> Rain, fog, and dew keep
          surfaces damp for weeks at a time. Moisture gets behind paint films
          and causes peeling, blistering, and adhesion failure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mildew and algae growth.</strong> Vancouver&apos;s mild
          winters mean mildew never fully dies off. North-facing walls and
          shaded areas turn green or black within a year if the paint does not
          contain mildewcide.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>UV exposure in summer.</strong> From May through August,
          south-facing walls get intense sun. Inferior paint chalks and fades.
          Good paint holds its colour for 10 to 15 years.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acrylic Latex vs. Oil-Based Paint</h2>

      <p>
        For Vancouver exteriors, 100% acrylic latex outperforms oil-based
        paint in every measurable category: flexibility, moisture
        breathability, mildew resistance, and longevity. Shape of Paint
        uses acrylic latex on virtually every exterior project across the
        Lower Mainland.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Vancouver exteriors, 100% acrylic latex paint wins every time.
        Here is why.
      </p>

      <p>
        Acrylic latex is flexible. It expands and contracts with temperature
        swings without cracking. It breathes, allowing trapped moisture to
        escape through the film instead of bubbling underneath. It resists
        mildew better than oil. It cleans up with water. And modern acrylic
        formulas bond to surfaces just as well as oil ever did.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oil-based paint creates a harder, less flexible film. In Vancouver&apos;s
        constant moisture cycles, that rigidity leads to cracking and peeling
        within 4 to 6 years. Oil also yellows over time, especially on
        north-facing walls that get less sun. There is no reason to use oil on
        exterior walls in this climate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The one exception: oil-based primer still has a role on bare wood and
        heavily stained surfaces, where its penetrating adhesion outperforms
        latex primers. But the topcoat should always be acrylic.
      </p>

      <h2>Top Products for Vancouver Exteriors</h2>

      <p>
        The three best exterior paints for Vancouver homes are Benjamin
        Moore Aura Exterior, Sherwin-Williams Duration Exterior, and
        Benjamin Moore Regal Select Exterior. All three are 100% acrylic
        latex formulations with built-in mildewcide designed for coastal
        and high-moisture climates.
      </p>

      <h3>Benjamin Moore Aura Exterior</h3>

      <p>
        Aura Exterior uses Color Lock technology that resists fading and
        provides excellent moisture resistance. According to Benjamin Moore,
        the Aura Exterior line delivers superior colour retention and
        adhesion even in high-humidity coastal environments. It self-primes
        on most surfaces in good condition and offers outstanding hide in a
        single coat, though two coats are always recommended for durability.
        A gallon runs about $85 to $95 at Vancouver retailers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best for: wood siding, Hardie board, previously painted surfaces in
        good condition. Available in flat, low lustre, satin, and semi-gloss.
      </p>

      <h3>Sherwin-Williams Duration Exterior</h3>

      <p>
        Duration is a thick, self-priming acrylic with PermaLast technology
        for long-lasting colour and finish. It goes on heavy and builds a
        thick film that holds up well against Vancouver rain. Excellent
        adhesion on chalky and weathered surfaces. A gallon runs about $80 to
        $90.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best for: wood siding, cement board, aluminum, and surfaces with
        moderate chalking or weathering. Available in flat, satin, and
        semi-gloss.
      </p>

      <h3>Benjamin Moore Regal Select Exterior</h3>

      <p>
        Regal Select is a step down from Aura in price but still delivers
        strong mildew resistance and colour retention. A solid mid-range
        choice for well-maintained homes. A gallon runs about $65
        to $75.
      </p>

      <p>
        Best for: well-maintained homes in decent condition with
        minimal prep needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Mildew-Resistant Formulas Matter Here</h2>

      <p>
        In Vancouver, standard mildewcide levels found in most paints are
        not sufficient for north-facing and shaded walls. Premium products
        like Aura Exterior and Duration contain elevated mildewcide
        concentrations, and supplemental mildewcide can be added at the
        mixing stage for high-risk surfaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every premium exterior paint contains mildewcide. But in Vancouver,
        standard mildewcide levels are often not enough. Look for paints
        explicitly marketed for high-humidity or coastal climates. Both Aura
        Exterior and Duration contain higher levels of mildewcide compared
        to their interior counterparts.
      </p>

      <p>
        For homes surrounded by trees or with walls that stay shaded most of
        the day, ask your painter about adding supplemental mildewcide to the
        paint at the mixing stage. Most paint stores can do this for a few
        dollars per gallon. It makes a real difference on north-facing walls.
      </p>

      <h2>Primer Is Not Optional</h2>

      <p>
        A dedicated primer coat is required on bare wood, stained surfaces,
        stucco with efflorescence, fully stripped surfaces, and dramatic
        colour changes. Even self-priming exterior paints cannot replace a
        proper primer in these Vancouver-common scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even self-priming paints need a dedicated primer coat in these
        situations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Bare wood that has never been painted</li>
        <li>Surfaces with heavy staining, tannin bleed, or knots</li>
        <li>Stucco or masonry with efflorescence (white salt deposits)</li>
        <li>Any surface where existing paint has been fully stripped</li>
        <li>Colour changes from very dark to very light or vice versa</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For stucco in Vancouver, a bonding primer designed for masonry is
        essential. It penetrates the porous surface and gives the topcoat
        something to grip. Without it, paint peels off stucco within 2 years
        in this climate.
      </p>

      <h2>Elastomeric Coatings for Stucco</h2>

      <p>
        Elastomeric coatings are thick, rubber-like paints that stretch up
        to 300% without cracking, making them the top choice for stucco
        homes in Vancouver. They cost $90 to $120 per gallon but last 15
        to 20 years — nearly double the lifespan of standard paint on
        stucco.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your home has stucco — and roughly 40% of Vancouver homes do —
        consider an elastomeric coating. These are thick, rubber-like paints
        that stretch up to 300% without cracking. They bridge hairline cracks
        in stucco and create a waterproof membrane that keeps rain out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elastomeric coatings cost more per gallon ($90 to $120) and require
        more product per square foot. But they last 15 to 20 years on stucco
        in Vancouver conditions. Standard paint on stucco rarely lasts more
        than 7 to 10 years. The timing of your project matters too — read our

        to make sure conditions are right for any coating.
      </p>

      <h2>Sheen Recommendations</h2>

      <p>
        The best exterior paint sheen for Vancouver is satin on body walls
        and semi-gloss on trim. Satin sheds water better than flat while
        hiding surface imperfections, and semi-gloss provides maximum
        moisture resistance on high-exposure trim, fascia, and railings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sheen affects both appearance and performance. Here is what works
        best in Vancouver.
      </p>

      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table className="w-full border-collapse text-lg">
          <thead>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Sheen</th>
              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Best For</th>
              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Trade-Off</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody className="text-text-secondary">
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Flat</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Stucco bodies, hiding imperfections</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Holds dirt and mildew; needs more washing</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Satin (eggshell)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Siding and stucco walls (best all-around)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Slight sheen visible at certain angles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Semi-gloss</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Trim, doors, fascia, railings</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Too shiny for large wall surfaces</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver exterior projects use satin on the body and semi-gloss
        on the trim. That combination gives you the best balance of
        appearance, durability, and moisture resistance.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        The best exterior paint for Vancouver is a premium 100% acrylic
        latex with elevated mildewcide, applied in satin sheen over a
        surface-specific primer. Benjamin Moore Aura Exterior and
        Sherwin-Williams Duration are the top two choices for rain, UV,
        and mildew resistance on Lower Mainland homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vancouver weather demands premium acrylic latex paint with built-in
        mildew resistance. Benjamin Moore Aura Exterior and Sherwin-Williams
        Duration are the top picks. Use a dedicated primer on bare or
        problem surfaces. Choose satin sheen for walls and semi-gloss for
        trim. And if you have stucco, seriously consider an elastomeric
        coating.
