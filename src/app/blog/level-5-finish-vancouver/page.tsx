      <p>
        A level 5 finish painting treatment is the highest grade of drywall preparation you
        can get. It eliminates every imperfection on your walls before paint goes on. Most
        homes in Vancouver have a level 3 or level 4 finish. That is fine for textured walls
        or rooms with limited natural light. But if you are using flat or matte paint in a
        room with large windows, anything less than level 5 shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide explains what each finish level means, when you actually need level 5,
        and what to expect from the process.
      </p>

      <h2>Drywall Finish Levels Explained</h2>

      <p>
        The Gypsum Association defines six levels of drywall finishing, numbered 0 through 5.
        Each level builds on the one below it.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 0: No Finish</h3>

      <p>
        Bare drywall with no tape, no mud, nothing. Used in temporary construction or areas
        above drop ceilings that nobody sees.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 1: Tape Only</h3>

      <p>
        Tape is embedded in joint compound at seams and corners. No smoothing or sanding.
        Used in areas above ceilings, in attics, or behind walls that will be covered by
        other materials.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 2: First Coat of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        One coat of joint compound over tape and fastener heads. Marks and ridges are
        acceptable. This is common in garages and storage areas where appearance does not
        matter.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 3: Two Coats of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        Two coats of compound over tape joints and one coat over fastener heads. Sanded
        smooth. This is the minimum level for walls that will receive a heavy texture or
        thick wallcovering. Many builders use this as their default on new construction to
        save time.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 4: Three Coats of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        Three coats over tape joints and two coats over fastener heads and accessories.
        Sanded smooth between coats. This is the standard for walls that receive paint. Most
        Vancouver homes are finished to level 4. It looks good with eggshell or satin finishes
        in rooms with moderate light.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 5: Skim Coat</h3>

      <p>
        Everything in level 4 plus a thin skim coat of joint compound applied over the entire
        surface. This creates a perfectly uniform texture across the whole wall. No ridges. No
        photographing. No visible joints. Just one smooth, consistent surface from corner to
        corner.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Level 5 Matters in Vancouver Homes</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver homes have a particular problem: low-angle natural light. Large west-facing
        windows, floor-to-ceiling glass, and open floor plans create raking light that travels
        across your walls at a sharp angle. That raking light reveals every imperfection in
        the drywall surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        At level 4, the joints and screw heads are smooth and sanded. But the paper face of
        the drywall has a slightly different texture than the mudded areas. In direct overhead
        light, you cannot tell. In raking light, those differences show up as shadowy lines
        and bumps running along every seam. Painters call this "photographing" or "flashing."
      </p>

      <p>
        Level 5 solves this by giving the entire wall the same surface texture. The skim coat
        covers both the paper and the mudded joints with one uniform layer. We apply it with
        a 14-inch knife in thin, overlapping passes, then sand to 220 grit. The result is a
        wall that looks perfect from every angle, in every light condition.
      </p>

      <h2>When You Need Level 5</h2>

      <p>
        Not every wall needs this treatment. Here is when it matters:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Flat or matte paint finishes. These sheens hide nothing. Every bump and joint
        shows through.</li>
        <li>Rooms with large windows or abundant natural light. The more light, the more
        imperfections you see.</li>
        <li>Accent walls that draw the eye. A single feature wall in a contrasting colour
        gets scrutinized.</li>
        <li>Dark paint colours. Dark shades amplify surface irregularities because they
        absorb more light and create sharper shadows.</li>
        <li>Open-concept spaces with long, unbroken walls. The longer the wall, the more
        obvious the joints become.</li>
        <li>High-end renovations where finish quality matters. If you are spending $50,000
        on a kitchen, the walls should match that standard.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When You Can Skip It</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Walls getting eggshell or satin paint in rooms with average light</li>
        <li>Textured walls (orange peel, knockdown, or skip trowel)</li>
        <li>Walls covered by wallpaper, tile, or wainscoting</li>
        <li>Closets, laundry rooms, and utility spaces</li>
        <li>Ceilings in rooms without skylights or pot lights that create raking light</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Skim Coat Process</h2>

      <p>
        Achieving a level 5 finish adds two to three steps to the standard drywall process.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Complete all level 4 work: three coats of USG Sheetrock joint compound on joints, two on fasteners, full sanding with 120-grit between coats.</li>
        <li>Apply a thin skim coat of compound over the entire wall surface using a 14-inch drywall knife. We use USG Plus 3 for its smooth workability and low shrinkage.</li>
        <li>Let the skim coat dry completely. This takes 12 to 24 hours depending on humidity and temperature.</li>
        <li>Sand the entire surface with 150-grit paper, then finish with 220-grit until it is perfectly smooth and even.</li>
        <li>Prime with two coats of Sherwin-Williams PVA Drywall Primer. This seals the surface and creates uniform porosity so the topcoat dries evenly from edge to edge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The whole process adds 1 to 2 days to a typical room and requires a skilled
        tradesperson. Skim coating is not a beginner task. Uneven application creates more
        problems than it solves.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Premium</h2>

      <p>
        A level 5 finish adds $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot of wall surface compared to a
        standard level 4. For a 12-by-14-foot bedroom, that is roughly $400 to $800 extra.
        For a full home, the premium runs $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the number of walls
        that need the treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most homeowners choose level 5 for the main living areas and bedrooms where flat
        paint and natural light matter most. Hallways, closets, and utility rooms stay at
        level 4. This targeted approach puts the budget where it makes the biggest difference.
