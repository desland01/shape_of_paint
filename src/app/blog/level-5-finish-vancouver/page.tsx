      <p>
        A level 5 finish painting treatment is the highest grade of drywall preparation you
        can get. It eliminates every imperfection on your walls before paint goes on. Most
        homes in Vancouver have a level 3 or level 4 finish. That is fine for textured walls
        or rooms with limited natural light. But if you are using flat or matte paint in a
        room with large windows, anything less than level 5 shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide explains what each finish level means, when you actually need level 5,
        and what to expect from the process.
      </p>

      <h2>Drywall Finish Levels Explained</h2>

      <p>
        The Gypsum Association defines six drywall finish levels numbered 0 through 5, each building on the one below it. Level 0 is bare drywall with no treatment, while level 5 adds a full skim coat over the entire surface for a perfectly uniform texture that eliminates photographing under raking light.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Gypsum Association defines six levels of drywall finishing, numbered 0 through 5.
        Each level builds on the one below it.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 0: No Finish</h3>

      <p>
        Bare drywall with no tape, no mud, nothing. Used in temporary construction or areas
        above drop ceilings that nobody sees.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 1: Tape Only</h3>

      <p>
        Tape is embedded in joint compound at seams and corners. No smoothing or sanding.
        Used in areas above ceilings, in attics, or behind walls that will be covered by
        other materials.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 2: First Coat of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        One coat of joint compound over tape and fastener heads. Marks and ridges are
        acceptable. This is common in garages and storage areas where appearance does not
        matter.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 3: Two Coats of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        Two coats of compound over tape joints and one coat over fastener heads. Sanded
        smooth. This is the minimum level for walls that will receive a heavy texture or
        thick wallcovering. Many builders use this as their default on new construction to
        save time.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 4: Three Coats of Mud</h3>

      <p>
        Three coats over tape joints and two coats over fastener heads and accessories.
        Sanded smooth between coats. This is the standard for walls that receive paint. Most
        Vancouver homes are finished to level 4. It looks good with eggshell or satin finishes
        in rooms with moderate light.
      </p>

      <h3>Level 5: Skim Coat</h3>

      <p>
        Everything in level 4 plus a thin skim coat of joint compound applied over the entire
        surface. This creates a perfectly uniform texture across the whole wall. No ridges. No
        photographing. No visible joints. Just one smooth, consistent surface from corner to
        corner.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Level 5 Matters in Vancouver Homes</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver homes with large west-facing windows, floor-to-ceiling glass, and open floor plans are especially prone to drywall photographing because low-angle natural light rakes across wall surfaces and reveals every seam. A level 5 skim coat gives the entire wall a uniform texture that eliminates these visible imperfections under any lighting condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vancouver homes have a particular problem: low-angle natural light. Large west-facing
        windows, floor-to-ceiling glass, and open floor plans create raking light that travels
        across your walls at a sharp angle. That raking light reveals every imperfection in
        the drywall surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        At level 4, the joints and screw heads are smooth and sanded. But the paper face of
        the drywall has a slightly different texture than the mudded areas. In direct overhead
        light, you cannot tell. In raking light, those differences show up as shadowy lines
        and bumps running along every seam. Painters call this "photographing" or "flashing."
      </p>

      <p>
        Level 5 solves this by giving the entire wall the same surface texture. The skim coat
        covers both the paper and the mudded joints with one uniform layer. We apply it with
        a 14-inch knife in thin, overlapping passes, then sand to 220 grit. The result is a
        wall that looks perfect from every angle, in every light condition.
      </p>

      <h2>When You Need Level 5</h2>

      <p>
        A level 5 drywall finish is necessary in Vancouver homes with flat or matte paint, large windows, dark accent colours, or long unbroken walls in open-concept spaces. Shape of Paint recommends level 5 for any room where natural raking light and a smooth paint sheen would reveal standard level 4 imperfections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not every wall needs this treatment. Here is when it matters:

      <h2>When You Can Skip It</h2>

      <p>
        Level 5 is not required for every wall in your home. Walls receiving eggshell or satin paint in rooms with average light, textured surfaces, or spaces covered by wallpaper, tile, or wainscoting perform well at level 4. Closets, laundry rooms, and utility spaces rarely justify the added investment.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Walls getting eggshell or satin paint in rooms with average light</li>
        <li>Textured walls (orange peel, knockdown, or skip trowel)</li>
        <li>Walls covered by wallpaper, tile, or wainscoting</li>
        <li>Closets, laundry rooms, and utility spaces</li>
        <li>Ceilings in rooms without skylights or pot lights that create raking light</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Skim Coat Process</h2>

      <p>
        Achieving a level 5 finish adds two to three steps beyond standard level 4 drywall work. The process involves completing all level 4 preparation, applying a thin skim coat of joint compound over the entire wall, drying for 12 to 24 hours, and sanding to 220 grit for a perfectly smooth, uniform surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        Achieving a level 5 finish adds two to three steps to the standard drywall process.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Complete all level 4 work: three coats of USG Sheetrock joint compound on joints, two on fasteners, full sanding with 120-grit between coats.</li>
        <li>Apply a thin skim coat of compound over the entire wall surface using a 14-inch drywall knife. We use USG Plus 3 for its smooth workability and low shrinkage.</li>
        <li>Let the skim coat dry completely. This takes 12 to 24 hours depending on humidity and temperature.</li>
        <li>Sand the entire surface with 150-grit paper, then finish with 220-grit until it is perfectly smooth and even.</li>
        <li>Prime with two coats of Sherwin-Williams PVA Drywall Primer. This seals the surface and creates uniform porosity so the topcoat dries evenly from edge to edge.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The whole process adds 1 to 2 days to a typical room and requires a skilled
        tradesperson. Skim coating is not a beginner task. Uneven application creates more
        problems than it solves.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Premium</h2>

      <p>
        A level 5 drywall finish in Vancouver adds $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot of wall surface compared to standard level 4 preparation. For a typical bedroom, that means an additional $400 to $800, while a full home runs $2,000 to $5,000 depending on how many rooms receive the treatment. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), drywall finishing quality is one of the top factors affecting long-term paint performance in Canadian homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A level 5 finish adds $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot of wall surface compared to a
        standard level 4. For a 12-by-14-foot bedroom, that is roughly $400 to $800 extra.
        For a full home, the premium runs $2,000 to $5,000 depending on the number of walls
        that need the treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most homeowners choose level 5 for the main living areas and bedrooms where flat
        paint and natural light matter most. Hallways, closets, and utility rooms stay at
        level 4. This targeted approach puts the budget where it makes the biggest difference.
