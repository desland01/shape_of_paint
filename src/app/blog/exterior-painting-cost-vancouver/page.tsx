      <p>
        If you are wondering how much to paint a house in Vancouver, you are
        asking the right question before starting an exterior project. A
        well-executed exterior paint job is one of the highest-return
        improvements you can make to your home. Most Vancouver homes cost
        between $5,000 and $20,000 to paint properly, depending on size, siding
        type, and the level of preparation your walls require.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the real answer depends on your specific home. A 1,500-square-foot
        rancher with clean cedar siding is a fundamentally different project
        than a 3,200-square-foot three-storey with weathered stucco on every
        wall. Here is a detailed breakdown so you can evaluate quotes with
        confidence.
      </p>

      <h2>What a Professional Exterior Transformation Costs by House Size</h2>

      <p>
        Exterior painting costs in Vancouver range from $5,000 for a small
        bungalow to $20,000 for a large multi-storey home. Shape of Paint
        prices every project based on square footage, siding type, and
        preparation scope — so your quote reflects your home, not a generic
        estimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        These ranges reflect what Vancouver homeowners invest in 2026 for a
        professional crew using premium coatings, thorough surface preparation,
        and a full 2-coat system.
      </p>

      <p>
        These numbers include labour, premium paint, primer, complete surface
        preparation, and cleanup. They do not include major structural repairs
        like replacing rotted boards or full stucco patching — those are quoted
        separately based on scope.
      </p>

      <h2>The 6 Factors That Define Your Project Scope</h2>

      <p>
        The six factors that most affect your Vancouver exterior painting
        cost are number of storeys, siding type, surface preparation needs,
        paint quality, trim complexity, and repairs required. Each one
        shifts your quote by hundreds or thousands of dollars.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Number of Storeys</h3>

      <p>
        Every storey above the first expands the project scope. A two-storey
        home requires extension ladders or scaffolding. A three-storey home
        needs full scaffolding, which typically adds $1,500 to $3,000 for setup
        and rental. Working at height also demands more time from the crew to
        maintain precision, so labour hours increase accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Siding Type</h3>

      <p>
        Different surfaces require different products and preparation
        techniques. Smooth Hardie board accepts paint quickly and evenly.
        Rough-sawn cedar siding absorbs more product and takes longer to coat
        properly. Stucco calls for elastomeric primers and specialty coatings.
        Vinyl siding being painted for the first time needs bonding primer.
        Each surface type changes the materials and technique involved. Read

        for your siding type.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Surface Preparation — The Craftsmanship That Makes a Finish Last</h3>

      <p>
        Preparation is where skilled crews distinguish themselves. A proper
        exterior job includes pressure washing, scraping loose paint, sanding
        rough edges, caulking every gap and joint, priming bare wood, and
        spot-priming stains. This is the work that determines whether your
        finish holds up for 12 to 15 years or begins failing in 3.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a well-maintained home, prep accounts for about 20% of total labour.
        On a home that has not been painted in 15 years, prep can exceed 40%.
        Either way, it is the foundation of a durable, beautiful result.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Paint Quality</h3>

      <p>
        A gallon of premium exterior paint like Benjamin Moore Aura or
        Sherwin-Williams Duration runs $75 to $95. Lower-grade coatings cost
        $35 to $45. The difference is not just price per gallon — premium
        formulations resist fading, chalking, and moisture penetration for 10
        to 15 years in Vancouver weather. According to Sherwin-Williams,
        their Duration Exterior line maintains colour and sheen retention
        for up to 15 years in coastal climates when applied with proper
        surface preparation. Inferior products begin breaking down
        in 3 to 5 years, which means a second full project far sooner than
        necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Trim and Detail Work</h3>

      <p>
        Trim, soffits, fascia, window frames, and railings all need separate
        preparation and careful brushwork. A home with simple trim adds $500 to
        $1,000. A heritage home with detailed woodwork, corbels, and
        multi-piece trim profiles can add $2,000 to $4,000 — and that detail
        work is often what gives a finished exterior its character.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Repairs Needed</h3>

      <p>
        Rotted fascia boards, cracked stucco, damaged caulking, and mildewed
        surfaces all need attention before any coating goes on. Minor repairs
        are typically included in the quote. Major work — replacing boards,
        patching large stucco sections, or treating wood rot — is itemized
        separately so you see exactly what you are paying for.
      </p>

      <h2>What a Complete Professional Quote Includes</h2>

      <p>
        A professional exterior painting quote in Vancouver should itemize
        surface prep, primer, two coats of premium paint, trim work,
        protection of landscaping, full cleanup, and a written warranty.
        Shape of Paint includes all nine steps in every estimate.
      </p>

      <p>
        A thorough exterior painting quote in Vancouver should cover all of the
        following. If any item is missing, it is worth asking why.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Pressure washing of all surfaces to be painted</li>
        <li>Scraping and sanding of loose or peeling paint</li>
        <li>Caulking of gaps, joints, and around window and door frames</li>
        <li>Priming of bare wood, stains, and repaired areas</li>
        <li>Two coats of premium exterior paint on all body surfaces</li>
        <li>One to two coats on all trim, fascia, and soffits</li>
        <li>Protection of landscaping, decks, walkways, and fixtures</li>
        <li>Full cleanup and removal of all materials</li>
        <li>Written warranty on labour and product</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What Separates a Quality Quote from an Incomplete One</h2>

      <p>
        A quality exterior painting quote details the exact products, number
        of coats, prep steps, and warranty terms. An incomplete quote leaves
        out scope items, which leads to surprise charges or premature failure.
        Vancouver homeowners should compare line items, not just bottom-line
        prices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Last summer we quoted two identical townhouses on the same street in
        East Vancouver. Same square footage, same siding, same number of
        storeys. Our quote for each was within $200 of the other. One
        homeowner mentioned they had received a second quote that came in 30%
        lower from another crew.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference was not price — it was scope. The lower quote specified
        a single coat instead of two, no primer on bare wood, no caulking, and
        a lower-grade coating that would need replacing within 3 to 5 years.
        It was a different job entirely.
      </p>

      <p>
        When comparing quotes, compare what is actually included. Ask what
        paint brand and product line they plan to use. Ask whether primer is
        part of the scope. Ask about their warranty. A crew that skips
        preparation or uses inferior products is not offering the same service
        at a lower price — they are offering a different service altogether.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get an Accurate Quote</h2>

      <p>
        The most accurate way to get an exterior painting quote in Vancouver
        is through an in-person visit where an estimator inspects every wall,
        measures surface area, and identifies repairs. Shape of Paint provides
        detailed on-site estimates at no charge.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most accurate exterior painting quotes come from an in-person
        visit. A skilled estimator will walk your entire home, assess every
        wall, note the siding type and condition, identify needed repairs,
        measure the surface area, and account for access challenges. That
        takes 30 to 45 minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone who quotes over the phone without seeing the property is
        estimating blind. And blind estimates lead to surprise charges or
        corners cut once the project is underway.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver exterior painting projects cost between $5,000 and
        $14,000 for average-sized homes, with larger properties reaching
        $20,000. According to CMHC, exterior maintenance including painting
        should be budgeted at 1% to 2% of a home&apos;s value annually to
        preserve long-term resale value.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver homeowners invest $5,000 to $14,000 in a quality
        exterior paint job that protects and transforms their home for the next
        decade. Larger homes and complex projects run $12,000 to $20,000. The
        biggest factors are house size, siding condition, and the quality of
        materials and preparation. Get 2 to 3 detailed quotes, compare the
        full scope of work, and choose the crew that explains their process —
        not just their price.
