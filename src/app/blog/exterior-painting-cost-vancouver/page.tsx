      <p>
        If you are wondering how much to paint a house in Vancouver, you are not
        alone. It is the number one question homeowners ask before starting an
        exterior project. The short answer: most Vancouver homes cost between
        $5,000 and $20,000 to paint, depending on size, siding type, and how
        much prep work the walls need.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the real answer depends on your specific home. A 1,500-square-foot
        rancher with clean cedar siding is a very different project than a
        3,200-square-foot three-storey with cracked stucco on every wall. Here
        is a detailed breakdown so you know what to expect before you call for
        quotes.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Ranges by House Size</h2>

      <p>
        These ranges reflect typical Vancouver pricing in 2026 for a
        professional crew using premium paint, proper surface prep, and a
        2-coat system.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1,500 sq ft home (small bungalow or rancher):</strong> $5,000
          to $8,000. Usually single-storey with straightforward access. A crew
          of 3 can finish in 3 to 5 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2,500 sq ft home (average two-storey):</strong> $8,000 to
          $14,000. Expect scaffolding or extension ladder work for the second
          floor. Add $500 to $1,500 for extra height access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3,000+ sq ft home (large or multi-storey):</strong> $12,000
          to $20,000. Three-storey homes or complex rooflines require
          scaffolding setups that add time and cost. Expect 7 to 12 days on
          site.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These numbers include labour, paint, primer, surface prep, and
        cleanup. They do not include major repairs like replacing rotted
        boards or full stucco patching — those are quoted separately.
      </p>

      <h2>The 6 Factors That Drive Your Price</h2>

      <h3>1. Number of Storeys</h3>

      <p>
        Every storey above the first adds cost. A two-storey home requires
        extension ladders or scaffolding. A three-storey home needs full
        scaffolding, which can add $1,500 to $3,000 just for the setup and
        rental. Working at height also slows the crew down, so labour hours
        increase.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Siding Type</h3>

      <p>
        Different surfaces absorb paint differently and need different prep.
        Smooth Hardie board takes paint quickly and evenly. Rough-sawn cedar
        siding absorbs more product and takes longer to cover. Stucco needs
        elastomeric primers and specialty coatings. Vinyl siding that is being
        painted for the first time needs bonding primer. Each surface changes
        the cost. Read more about how{" "}

        for your siding type.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Surface Prep</h3>

      <p>
        Prep work is where the real value lives. A proper exterior job includes
        pressure washing, scraping loose paint, sanding rough edges, caulking
        gaps and joints, priming bare wood, and spot-priming stains. On a
        well-maintained home, prep takes 20% of the total labour. On a home
        that has not been painted in 15 years, prep can take 40% or more.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Paint Quality</h3>

      <p>
        A gallon of premium exterior paint like Benjamin Moore Aura or
        Sherwin-Williams Duration costs $75 to $95. Builder-grade paint costs
        $35 to $45. The difference is not just price — premium paint lasts 10
        to 15 years in Vancouver weather while cheap paint starts fading and
        chalking in 3 to 5 years. You pay less upfront, then pay again sooner.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Trim and Detail Work</h3>

      <p>
        Trim, soffits, fascia, window frames, and railings all need separate
        prep and brushwork. A home with simple trim adds $500 to $1,000. A
        heritage home with detailed woodwork, corbels, and multi-piece trim
        profiles can add $2,000 to $4,000 to the total.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Repairs Needed</h3>

      <p>
        Rotted fascia boards, cracked stucco, damaged caulking, and mildewed
        surfaces all need fixing before paint goes on. Minor repairs are
        usually included in the quote. Major repairs — replacing boards,
        patching large stucco sections, or treating wood rot — are itemized
        separately.
      </p>

      <h2>What Should Be Included in Your Quote</h2>

      <p>
        A professional exterior painting quote in Vancouver should include all
        of the following. If it does not, ask why.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Pressure washing of all surfaces to be painted</li>
        <li>Scraping and sanding of loose or peeling paint</li>
        <li>Caulking of gaps, joints, and around window and door frames</li>
        <li>Priming of bare wood, stains, and repaired areas</li>
        <li>Two coats of premium exterior paint on all body surfaces</li>
        <li>One to two coats on all trim, fascia, and soffits</li>
        <li>Protection of landscaping, decks, walkways, and fixtures</li>
        <li>Full cleanup and removal of all materials</li>
        <li>Written warranty on labour and product</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why the Cheapest Quote Usually Costs More</h2>

      <p>
        A quote that is 30% below everyone else almost always means shortcuts.
        Single-coat coverage instead of two. Skipped primer. No caulking.
        Builder-grade paint that fades in 3 years. Or an unlicensed crew with
        no WorkSafeBC coverage — which means you are liable if someone falls
        off your roof.
      </p>

      <p>
        We see homeowners every year who paid $4,000 for a job that needed
        $8,000 of prep and materials. Within 2 to 3 years the paint is peeling,
        caulking has cracked, and they need the whole thing redone. That
        $4,000 "deal" turned into $12,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compare the scope of each quote, not just the bottom line. Ask what
        paint brand and product line they plan to use. Ask if primer is
        included. Ask about their warranty. The answers tell you everything.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get an Accurate Quote</h2>

      <p>
        The most accurate exterior painting quotes come from an in-person
        visit. A reputable painter will walk around your home, check every
        wall, note the siding type and condition, identify repairs, measure
        the surface area, and factor in access challenges. That takes 30 to 45
        minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone who quotes you over the phone without seeing the house is
        guessing. And guesses lead to surprise charges halfway through the
        project.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Most Vancouver homeowners pay $5,000 to $14,000 for a quality exterior
        paint job. Larger homes and complex projects run $12,000 to $20,000.
        The biggest factors are house size, siding condition, and paint
        quality. Get 2 to 3 detailed quotes, compare what is included, and
        choose the crew that explains the process, not just the price.
