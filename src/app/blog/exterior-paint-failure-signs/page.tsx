      <p>
        Peeling paint on your exterior is more than ugly — it is your home
        telling you something is wrong. Every year, Vancouver homeowners
        spend thousands more than they needed to because they ignored the
        early warning signs. Catching paint failure early can mean the
        difference between a $1,500 spot repair and a $15,000 full repaint.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are the 6 warning signs to watch for, what causes each one, and
        what you should do about it before the damage spreads.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Peeling and Flaking</h2>

      <p>
        Peeling and flaking is the most common exterior paint failure in
        Vancouver. It is caused by moisture behind the paint film, poor
        surface preparation, or incompatible paint layers. Small peeling
        spots under 2 square feet can be spot-repaired, but widespread
        peeling requires a full wall repaint.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        Paint lifts away from the surface in sheets, curls, or chips. You
        can see bare wood, stucco, or a previous paint layer underneath.
        Peeling usually starts at edges, corners, and around windows where
        moisture enters first.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Moisture behind the paint.</strong> This is the number one
          cause in Vancouver. Rain, condensation, or plumbing leaks push
          moisture through the wall from inside. The paint film traps it,
          pressure builds, and the film lets go.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Poor surface prep.</strong> If the surface was not cleaned,
          sanded, or primed before painting, the new paint never bonded
          properly. It was only a matter of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incompatible paint layers.</strong> Latex over uncured oil,
          or a hard coating over a flexible one. The layers expand at
          different rates and separate.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Small peeling spots (under 2 square feet) can be scraped, sanded,
        primed, and repainted as a spot repair. If peeling covers more than
        10% of a wall, the entire wall needs to be scraped back and repainted.
        If moisture is the cause, you need to find and fix the water source
        first — otherwise the new paint will peel too.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Bubbling and Blistering</h2>

      <p>
        Bubbling and blistering in exterior paint appears as raised bumps
        on the surface, most commonly on south-facing and west-facing
        walls. The three main causes in Vancouver are heat blistering from
        direct sun, moisture vapor moving through the wall, and paint
        applied on hot surfaces.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        Raised bumps in the paint surface, ranging from pinhead-sized to
        several inches across. Some are filled with liquid. Others are dry
        and hollow. They appear most often on south-facing and west-facing
        walls.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Heat blistering.</strong> The sun heats the surface faster
          than the paint can handle. Moisture or solvent trapped under the
          film turns to vapor and pushes the paint outward. Common on dark
          colours facing direct afternoon sun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moisture blistering.</strong> Water vapor moves through the
          wall and gets trapped under the paint film. This is more common
          on walls near bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms — anywhere
          humid indoor air pushes moisture outward.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Painting in direct sun.</strong> If the surface was hot
          when the paint was applied, the outer layer dried instantly while
          the layer underneath stayed wet. As it dried later, it pushed the
          cured top layer outward.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Pop the blisters. If you see bare substrate, moisture is the likely
        cause — fix the moisture source. If you see a previous paint layer,
        heat or application error is more likely. Scrape, sand, prime, and
        repaint affected areas. Consider a lighter colour if the wall gets
        intense sun.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Chalking</h2>

      <p>
        Chalking is a powdery residue that comes off on your hand when you
        rub the painted surface. Some chalking after 8 to 10 years is
        normal and even designed into certain exterior paints. Heavy
        chalking within 3 to 5 years signals low-quality paint that was
        not rated for Vancouver&apos;s UV exposure.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        Run your hand across the painted surface. If a powdery residue comes
        off on your fingers, that is chalk. It looks like the paint is fading,
        and the colour transfers when you touch it. You will see it most on
        south-facing walls and flat-sheen paints.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

      <p>
        UV light breaks down the paint binder over time, releasing pigment
        particles as loose powder. Some chalking is normal after 8 to 10
        years — it is actually a self-cleaning mechanism designed into some
        exterior paints. Heavy chalking within 3 to 5 years means the paint
        quality was too low for the exposure level.
      </p>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Light chalking can be power-washed off before repainting. Heavy
        chalking needs a bonding primer to seal the remaining chalk layer
        before new paint goes on. Painting over heavy chalk without priming
        is a guarantee of peeling within a year.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Fading</h2>

      <p>
        Fading occurs when UV radiation breaks down paint pigments, making
        colours appear washed out. Reds, blues, and dark greens fade
        fastest. According to Sherwin-Williams, premium exterior coatings
        with advanced UV-blocking resins retain their colour up to 3 times
        longer than standard formulations in direct sun exposure.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        The colour looks washed out or lighter than when it was first
        painted. Especially noticeable on reds, blues, and dark greens.
        South-facing walls fade faster than north-facing walls.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

      <p>
        UV radiation breaks down pigments. Organic pigments (used in bright
        reds, blues, and greens) fade faster than inorganic pigments (earth
        tones, whites, greys). Lower-grade paints use inferior pigments that
        fade in 3 to 5 years. Premium paints with UV-resistant formulas hold
        colour for 10 to 15 years.
      </p>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Fading alone does not mean the paint is failing structurally. If the
        film is still intact, you can repaint for cosmetic reasons when you
        are ready. Choose a premium paint with UV-blocking technology and
        consider a colour with more stable pigments if you want maximum
        longevity.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Mildew and Algae Growth</h2>

      <p>
        Mildew and algae growth is the most common exterior paint problem
        in Vancouver due to persistent moisture and mild winters that
        never fully kill mildew spores. Black, green, or grey splotches
        concentrate on north-facing walls, under eaves, and in any area
        that stays shaded and damp.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        Black, green, or grey splotches on the surface. Concentrated on
        north-facing walls, under eaves, and anywhere that stays shaded and
        damp. Vancouver&apos;s mild, wet climate makes mildew the most
        common exterior paint problem in the region.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Wash the affected area with a mildew-killing solution (1 part bleach
        to 3 parts water, or a commercial mildew wash). Let it sit for 15
        minutes, scrub with a soft brush, and rinse thoroughly. If the
        mildew is only on the surface, you can often clean and leave it. If
        it keeps coming back, the area needs repainting with a
        high-mildewcide paint in satin or semi-gloss sheen. Trim
        overhanging branches to improve airflow.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Cracking (Alligator Skin)</h2>

      <p>
        Alligator cracking is a pattern of deep, interconnected cracks
        caused by too many rigid paint layers that can no longer flex with
        the building. Unlike peeling, alligator cracking cannot be
        spot-repaired — all cracked paint must be scraped or chemically
        stripped back to a sound surface.
      </p>

      <h3>What It Looks Like</h3>

      <p>
        A pattern of interconnected cracks resembling alligator skin or dried
        mud. The cracks go deep, sometimes through multiple layers of paint
        down to bare substrate.
      </p>

      <h3>What Causes It</h3>

      <p>
        Too many layers of old paint that have lost flexibility. Each layer
        becomes more rigid over time. Eventually the stack cannot flex with
        the building&apos;s natural movement and cracks throughout. Also
        caused by applying a hard topcoat over a softer undercoat, or by
        paint that was applied too thick.
      </p>

      <h3>What to Do</h3>

      <p>
        Alligator cracking cannot be spot-repaired. All cracked paint must
        be scraped or stripped back to a sound surface. The area is then
        primed and repainted. On heavily cracked surfaces, chemical
        stripping may be necessary. Timing your repaint properly makes a

      <h2>The Homeowner Inspection Checklist</h2>

      <p>
        Vancouver homeowners should walk the perimeter of their home once
        a year — ideally in spring after the wet season — and check every
        wall for 8 specific warning signs. According to CMHC, annual
        exterior inspections catch small problems before they become
        major repairs, reducing long-term maintenance costs by up to 50%.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walk around your home once a year — ideally in spring after the wet
        season — and check each wall for:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Peeling or flaking paint at edges, corners, and joints</li>
        <li>Bubbles or blisters on sun-exposed walls</li>
        <li>Chalky residue when you rub the surface</li>
        <li>Noticeable colour fading compared to shaded areas</li>
        <li>Black, green, or grey mildew patches</li>
        <li>Cracking patterns in the paint film</li>
        <li>Caulk that has pulled away from window and door frames</li>
        <li>Soft spots in wood siding that could indicate rot</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If you find 1 or 2 small areas, a spot repair may be all you need.
        If you find problems on multiple walls, it is time to plan a full
        exterior repaint before the damage gets worse.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Exterior paint failure gives you warning signs months or years
        before it becomes a serious problem. The six signs to watch are
        peeling, bubbling, chalking, fading, mildew, and cracking. Shape
        of Paint offers free exterior inspections for Vancouver homeowners
        who want an honest assessment of their home&apos;s condition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paint failure does not happen overnight. It gives you warning signs
        months or years before it becomes a serious problem. Peeling,
        bubbling, chalking, fading, mildew, and cracking each tell you
        something specific about what went wrong and what needs to happen
        next. Catch it early and you protect your home from far costlier damage down the road.
