      <p>
        Cabinet refinishing in Vancouver is the most cost-effective way to transform your
        kitchen without a full renovation. But it is not the only option. Refacing is
        another path that some homeowners consider. The two sound similar, but they are
        very different in scope, cost, and results. Here is a clear breakdown so you can
        make the right choice.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Cabinet Refinishing?</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing means painting or staining your existing cabinet doors, drawer fronts,
        and frames. Nothing gets replaced. Your cabinet boxes stay in place. Your doors
        stay the same. Only the surface finish changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional refinishing project in Vancouver follows these steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove all doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Clean and degrease every surface</li>
        <li>Sand to create a bonding profile</li>
        <li>Apply a bonding primer (BIN shellac or Stix)</li>
        <li>Spray 2 coats of acrylic alkyd finish (like Benjamin Moore Advance)</li>
        <li>Reinstall everything with new or existing hardware</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The entire process takes 3 to 5 days for an average-sized kitchen. You keep your
        existing layout. You keep your existing doors. You get a completely new look at a
        fraction of the cost of any other kitchen update.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Cabinet Refacing?</h2>

      <p>
        Refacing means replacing your cabinet doors and drawer fronts with brand-new ones
        while keeping the existing boxes. The boxes get covered with a matching veneer or
        laminate to create a uniform look.
      </p>

      <p>
        A typical refacing project in Vancouver includes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove existing doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Apply veneer or laminate to all visible box surfaces</li>
        <li>Install new doors and drawer fronts (custom-ordered to fit)</li>
        <li>Install new hinges and hardware</li>
        <li>Adjust and align everything</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Refacing takes 3 to 5 days for installation, but the new doors need to be ordered
        first. That adds 3 to 6 weeks of lead time before work begins.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>

      <h3>Refinishing (Painting)</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Small kitchen (15-25 doors): $2,500 to $4,000</li>
        <li>Medium kitchen (25-40 doors): $4,000 to $6,000</li>
        <li>Large kitchen (40-60+ doors): $6,000 to $9,000</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Refacing</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Small kitchen: $5,000 to $8,000</li>
        <li>Medium kitchen: $8,000 to $15,000</li>
        <li>Large kitchen: $15,000 to $22,000</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Refacing costs 2 to 3 times more than refinishing for the same kitchen. The price
        jump comes from manufacturing new doors, ordering veneer, and the added labour of
        applying laminate to every visible box surface.
      </p>

      <h2>Pros of Refinishing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Lowest cost option — 60% to 70% less than refacing</li>
        <li>Fastest turnaround — 3 to 5 days, no lead time for ordering parts</li>
        <li>Zero waste — nothing goes to the landfill</li>
        <li>Keeps your existing door style and layout</li>
        <li>Spray finish looks identical to factory-coated doors</li>
        <li>Easy to change colour again in 8 to 12 years</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cons of Refinishing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Does not change the door profile or style (raised panel stays raised panel)</li>
        <li>Doors with severe physical damage cannot be painted over</li>
        <li>Thermofoil or vinyl-wrapped doors may not be good candidates</li>
        <li>Deep grain on oak doors may still show through paint (though grain filler helps)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pros of Refacing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>You get brand-new doors and drawer fronts</li>
        <li>You can change from one door style to another (raised panel to Shaker, for example)</li>
        <li>New doors have no wear, scratches, or damage</li>
        <li>Includes new hinges and hardware</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cons of Refacing</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Costs 2 to 3 times more than refinishing</li>
        <li>3 to 6 weeks lead time for custom door orders</li>
        <li>Veneer on cabinet boxes can peel over time if applied poorly</li>
        <li>Limited colour and finish options compared to paint</li>
        <li>If one door gets damaged later, you need a custom replacement to match</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>

      <h3>Choose Refinishing If...</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Your cabinet boxes and doors are in good structural condition</li>
        <li>You like your current door style and layout</li>
        <li>You want the job done in under a week</li>
        <li>Your budget is under $10,000</li>
        <li>You want to choose from unlimited paint colours</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Choose Refacing If...</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Your doors are physically damaged, warped, or delaminating</li>
        <li>You want a completely different door style</li>
        <li>Your cabinet boxes are solid but the doors are beyond repair</li>
        <li>Budget is not the primary concern</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Most Vancouver Homeowners Choose Refinishing</h2>

      <p>
        About 8 out of 10 kitchen cabinet projects we see in Vancouver are refinishing,
        not refacing. The reason is simple. Most cabinets built in the last 25 years have
        solid boxes and structurally sound doors. The finish has worn out, but the
        cabinets themselves are fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional spray finish makes those same doors look factory-new. And it costs
        a fraction of what refacing runs. For a deeper look at why spray finishing
        outperforms other methods, read our{" "}

        comparison.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing gives you a brand-new kitchen look at the lowest cost and shortest
        timeline. Refacing makes sense only when your doors are physically damaged beyond
        what paint can fix. For 80% of Vancouver kitchens, refinishing is the smarter
        investment.
