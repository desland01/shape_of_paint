      <p>
        Cabinet refinishing in Vancouver gives you something factory refacing
        simply cannot — a fully custom, hand-finished result tailored to your
        exact colour and sheen. Refacing is another path that some homeowners
        consider. The two sound similar, but they are very different in scope,
        process, and results. Here is a clear breakdown so you can make the
        right choice.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Cabinet Refinishing?</h2>

      <p>
        Cabinet refinishing means painting or staining your existing doors, drawer
        fronts, and frames without replacing anything. Shape of Paint completes most
        Vancouver kitchen refinishing projects in 3 to 5 days using HVLP spray
        equipment, bonding primer, and acrylic alkyd finish coats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refinishing means painting or staining your existing cabinet doors, drawer fronts,
        and frames. Nothing gets replaced. Your cabinet boxes stay in place. Your doors
        stay the same. Only the surface finish changes.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional refinishing project in Vancouver follows these steps:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove all doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Clean and degrease every surface</li>
        <li>Sand to create a bonding profile</li>
        <li>Apply a bonding primer (BIN shellac or Stix)</li>
        <li>Spray 2 coats of acrylic alkyd finish (like Benjamin Moore Advance)</li>
        <li>Reinstall everything with new or existing hardware</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The entire process takes 3 to 5 days for an average-sized kitchen. You keep your
        existing layout. You keep your existing doors. And because every coat is applied by
        a master sprayer — not a factory line — you get a smoother, more even finish
        with unlimited colour options.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Cabinet Refacing?</h2>

      <p>
        Cabinet refacing replaces your doors and drawer fronts with brand-new
        factory-made pieces while keeping the existing boxes, which get covered with
        matching veneer or laminate. The process takes 3 to 5 days for installation but
        requires 3 to 6 weeks of lead time for custom door orders.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refacing means replacing your cabinet doors and drawer fronts with brand-new ones
        while keeping the existing boxes. The boxes get covered with a matching veneer or
        laminate to create a uniform look.
      </p>

      <p>
        A typical refacing project in Vancouver includes:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Remove existing doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Apply veneer or laminate to all visible box surfaces</li>
        <li>Install new doors and drawer fronts (custom-ordered to fit)</li>
        <li>Install new hinges and hardware</li>
        <li>Adjust and align everything</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Refacing takes 3 to 5 days for installation, but the new doors need to be ordered
        first. That adds 3 to 6 weeks of lead time before work begins.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing costs 60% to 70% less than refacing for the same Vancouver kitchen.
        A medium kitchen runs $4,000 to $6,000 for refinishing versus $8,000 to $15,000
        for refacing — and the hand-sprayed finish from Shape of Paint is smoother than
        factory-applied coatings on new doors.

              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$5,000 to $8,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Medium (25-40 doors)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$4,000 to $6,000</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$8,000 to $15,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Large (40-60+ doors)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$6,000 to $9,000</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">$15,000 to $22,000</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Refacing costs 2 to 3 times more than refinishing for the same kitchen. The price
        jump comes from manufacturing new doors, ordering veneer, and the added labour of
        applying laminate to every visible box surface.
      </p>

      <h2>Pros of Refinishing</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing offers 8 distinct advantages over refacing for Vancouver homeowners:
        superior hand-sprayed finish quality, unlimited colour selection, faster
        turnaround, zero waste, and an investment that runs 60% to 70% less than refacing
        for a finer result.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Superior finish quality — a master sprayer produces a smoother, more even coat than factory-applied finishes</li>
        <li>Unlimited colour selection — any Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams, or custom-matched colour, in any sheen</li>
        <li>Hand-sprayed finish — each door is prepped, primed, and sprayed individually for a custom result</li>
        <li>Fastest turnaround — 3 to 5 days, no lead time for ordering parts</li>
        <li>Zero waste — nothing goes to the landfill</li>
        <li>Keeps your existing door style and layout</li>
        <li>Easy to update the colour again in 8 to 12 years</li>
        <li>More efficient investment — 60% to 70% less than refacing for a finer finish</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cons of Refinishing</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing is not suitable when doors are severely damaged, warped, or made of
        thermofoil or vinyl-wrap materials. It also cannot change the door profile style —
        a raised panel stays a raised panel after painting.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Does not change the door profile or style (raised panel stays raised panel)</li>
        <li>Doors with severe physical damage cannot be painted over</li>
        <li>Thermofoil or vinyl-wrapped doors may not be good candidates</li>
        <li>Deep grain on oak doors may still show through paint (though grain filler helps)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Pros of Refacing</h2>

      <p>
        Refacing makes sense when you want a completely different door style or when
        existing doors are physically damaged beyond what paint can repair. You get
        brand-new doors and hardware while keeping the existing cabinet boxes.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>You get brand-new doors and drawer fronts</li>
        <li>You can change from one door style to another (raised panel to Shaker, for example)</li>
        <li>New doors have no wear, scratches, or damage</li>
        <li>Includes new hinges and hardware</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cons of Refacing</h2>

      <p>
        Refacing costs 2 to 3 times more than refinishing, requires 3 to 6 weeks of lead
        time for custom door orders, and limits your colour and finish options to what the
        manufacturer stocks. Veneer applied to cabinet boxes can also peel over time.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Costs 2 to 3 times more than refinishing</li>
        <li>3 to 6 weeks lead time for custom door orders</li>
        <li>Veneer on cabinet boxes can peel over time if applied poorly</li>
        <li>Limited colour and finish options compared to paint</li>
        <li>If one door gets damaged later, you need a custom replacement to match</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Which One Should You Choose?</h2>

      <p>
        Choose refinishing if your cabinet boxes and doors are structurally sound and you
        want a hand-finished result with unlimited colour options in under a week. Choose
        refacing only if your doors are physically damaged or you want a completely
        different door style.
      </p>

      <h3>Choose Refinishing If...</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Your cabinet boxes and doors are in good structural condition</li>
        <li>You like your current door style and layout</li>
        <li>You want the job done in under a week</li>
        <li>You want a hand-finished result that factory doors can&apos;t replicate</li>
        <li>You want to choose from unlimited paint colours</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Choose Refacing If...</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Your doors are physically damaged, warped, or delaminating</li>
        <li>You want a completely different door style</li>
        <li>Your cabinet boxes are solid but the doors are beyond repair</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Most Vancouver Homeowners Choose Refinishing</h2>

      <p>
        About 8 out of 10 cabinet projects Shape of Paint sees in Vancouver are
        refinishing, not refacing. Most cabinets built in the last 25 years have solid
        boxes and structurally sound doors where only the surface finish has worn out.
      </p>

      <p>
        About 8 out of 10 kitchen cabinet projects we see in Vancouver are refinishing,
        not refacing. The reason is simple. Most cabinets built in the last 25 years have
        solid boxes and structurally sound doors. The finish has worn out, but the
        cabinets themselves are fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association (NKBA), cabinet
        refinishing has grown steadily as a percentage of kitchen renovation projects
        across North America, driven by homeowners seeking custom colour options and
        faster project timelines compared to full replacement or refacing.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional spray finish from a skilled painter actually surpasses factory
        coatings — finer atomization, more even coverage, and a colour palette that is
        not limited to a manufacturer&apos;s catalogue. For a deeper look at why spray
        finishing outperforms other methods, read our{" "}

        comparison.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        For 80% of Vancouver kitchens, refinishing delivers a superior, fully customized
        finish with a faster timeline and more efficient investment than refacing. Shape
        of Paint recommends refinishing whenever cabinet boxes and doors are structurally
        sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refinishing delivers a superior, fully customized finish — and the timeline and
        investment are both more efficient than refacing. Refacing makes sense only when
        your doors are physically damaged beyond what paint can fix. For 80% of Vancouver
        kitchens, refinishing is the smarter choice.
