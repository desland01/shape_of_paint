      <p>
        Spray painting cabinets produces a smoother, harder, more factory-like finish
        than any brush or roller can achieve. If you are refinishing your kitchen cabinets
        in Vancouver, the application method matters just as much as the paint itself.
        Here is why professional spray finishing is the gold standard for cabinet work.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Brush Marks Show on Cabinets</h2>

      <p>
        Cabinet doors sit at eye level. You see them up close every single day. Any
        texture — brush strokes, roller stipple, drip marks — is immediately obvious.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you brush or roll paint onto a flat cabinet door, the bristles or roller nap
        leave tiny ridges in the wet film. Even with self-levelling paints like Benjamin
        Moore Advance, you can still see subtle texture once the light hits the surface.
        On a wall 10 feet away, nobody notices. On a cabinet door 2 feet from your face,
        it is the first thing you see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paint also builds up at edges when brushed. Cabinet doors have profiles, edges,
        and panel details where paint pools and drips. Spraying applies a thin, even coat
        across every surface at once. No pooling. No drips. No brush marks.
      </p>

      <h2>How HVLP Spray Finishing Works</h2>

      <p>
        HVLP stands for High Volume, Low Pressure. It is the same technology that
        furniture factories and automotive shops use. Here is how it works for cabinets:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Doors and drawer fronts are removed and taken to a controlled spray area</li>
        <li>Each piece is cleaned, sanded to 220 grit, and wiped with a tack cloth</li>
        <li>A bonding primer is sprayed in a thin, even coat and allowed to dry</li>
        <li>The primer is lightly sanded with 320 grit for a perfectly smooth base</li>
        <li>Two finish coats are sprayed, with light sanding between coats</li>
        <li>Each coat dries in a dust-free environment to prevent debris in the finish</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The result is a surface that feels glass-smooth. No brush texture. No roller
        stipple. Just a clean, even sheen that catches light uniformly. Choosing the right
        product matters too — read our guide on the{" "}

      <h2>Finish Quality Comparison</h2>

      <h3>Spray Finish</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Glass-smooth surface with zero texture</li>
        <li>Even sheen across flat panels, edges, and profiles</li>
        <li>No brush marks, drips, or roller stipple</li>
        <li>Thinner, more even coats that cure harder</li>
        <li>Looks identical to a factory finish</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Brush and Roller Finish</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Visible texture under direct light</li>
        <li>Uneven thickness at edges and profiles</li>
        <li>Higher chance of drips on vertical surfaces</li>
        <li>Thicker coats that take longer to cure</li>
        <li>Looks hand-painted (and not in a good way on cabinets)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Durability Differences</h2>

      <p>
        Sprayed coats are thinner and more uniform than brushed coats. That means they
        cure faster and harder. A sprayed Benjamin Moore Advance coat reaches full
        hardness in about 14 days. A heavy brushed coat of the same product can take
        21 to 30 days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why does this matter? Kitchen cabinets get opened and closed 20 to 30 times per
        day. Sticky fingers. Cooking grease. Steam from the dishwasher. A harder, fully
        cured finish resists all of that better than a soft, thick brushed coat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spray-applied finishes also adhere more evenly. When paint is brushed on too
        thick, the outer layer skins over while the interior stays soft. That creates
        weak spots where the finish can peel later.
      </p>

      <h2>Drying Time Differences</h2>

      <p>
        Sprayed coats are thin — typically 2 to 3 mils per coat. They dry to touch in
        30 to 60 minutes and can be recoated in 4 to 6 hours. A full spray job with
        primer and 2 topcoats can be completed in 2 to 3 days for the spraying alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Brushed coats tend to be 4 to 6 mils thick. They need 6 to 8 hours between coats
        and 24 hours before handling. A brushed cabinet project takes 5 to 7 days just
        for the paint to be ready for reassembly. And the finish still will not be as hard
        as a sprayed one.
      </p>

      <h2>When Brush and Roller Makes Sense</h2>

      <p>
        There are a few situations where a brush is the right tool:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Small touch-ups on previously sprayed cabinets</li>
        <li>Tight corners inside cabinet boxes that spray cannot reach</li>
        <li>Single doors or drawer fronts that need repair after installation</li>
        <li>Interior cabinet surfaces where cosmetic finish is less critical</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For the exterior surfaces of your cabinets — the doors, drawer fronts, and frames
        that everyone sees — spray is always the better choice.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Not All Painters Spray</h2>

      <p>
        Spray equipment costs $2,000 to $5,000. It requires a controlled environment
        free of dust and debris. The painter needs training to achieve consistent film
        thickness without runs or sags. And overspray means every nearby surface must be
        carefully masked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many general painters do not own spray equipment or have the setup to use it
        properly. That is why they offer brush-and-roller on cabinets. It requires
        less equipment on their end — but the result is far worse for you. If a painter quotes cabinets and does not mention spray
        finishing, keep looking.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Your cabinets are the most visible surface in your kitchen. A spray finish makes
        them look like they came straight from a factory. A brush finish makes them look
        like a weekend DIY project. The difference is visible from across the room.
