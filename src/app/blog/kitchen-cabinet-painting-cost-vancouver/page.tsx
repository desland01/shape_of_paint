      <p>
        Kitchen cabinet painting in Vancouver costs between $2,500 and $9,000 in 2026.
        The exact investment depends on your kitchen size, the number of doors, the type of
        finish, and the condition of your existing cabinets. I put this guide together so
        you know exactly what goes into a proper fine-finish cabinet job — and
        why the process and materials matter.
      </p>

      <h2>Investment by Kitchen Size</h2>

      <h3>Small Kitchen (15 to 25 Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        A small galley or condo kitchen with 15 to 25 doors and drawer fronts typically
        runs $2,500 to $4,000. That covers full removal, thorough cleaning, hand sanding,
        bonding primer on every surface, and 2 coats of HVLP spray-applied finish with
        precise reinstallation. Most small kitchens take 3 days of dedicated work.
      </p>

      <h3>Medium Kitchen (25 to 40 Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        The average Vancouver kitchen falls here. Expect $4,000 to $6,000 for a complete
        spray finish on all doors, drawer fronts, and cabinet frames. This is the most
        common range we quote — and where you really see the difference a master sprayer
        makes. Plan for 4 days of work.
      </p>

      <h3>Large Kitchen (40 to 60+ Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        Large kitchens with islands, pantries, and butler stations run $6,000 to $9,000.
        Custom homes in Vancouver with 70+ doors can reach $10,000 to $12,000. These
        projects demand 5 to 7 working days and the kind of controlled, methodical
        process that produces a flawless result on every surface.
      </p>

      <h2>What Drives the Investment</h2>

      <h3>Number of Doors and Drawer Fronts</h3>

      <p>
        This is the biggest factor. Each door is removed, labelled, cleaned, sanded by
        hand, primed with a bonding primer, and sprayed with 2 finish coats using HVLP
        equipment in a controlled environment. Every piece gets individual attention.
        A kitchen with 40 doors requires roughly double the labour and material of a
        kitchen with 20.
      </p>

      <h3>Colour Change</h3>

      <p>
        Going from dark stained wood to white or light grey is one of the most
        technically demanding transformations in cabinet work. The existing finish needs
        heavier sanding. A coat of shellac-based primer is essential to block tannin
        bleed — skip this step and yellow blotches appear within weeks. That precision
        adds $300 to $800 to the total.
      </p>

      <h3>Finish Type</h3>

      <p>
        A professional spray finish with a product like Benjamin Moore Advance delivers
        a beautiful result. Catalyzed lacquer or conversion varnish takes it further —
        producing a harder, more chemical-resistant surface that rivals factory finishes.
        High-performance finishes add $500 to $1,500 and are worth every dollar in
        high-traffic kitchens. For help choosing the right product, check our guide on{" "}

        .
      </p>

      <h3>Cabinet Condition</h3>

      <p>
        Cabinets with peeling laminate, grease buildup, or minor damage need extra prep
        before they can accept a fine finish. A skilled crew will degrease with TSP, sand
        thoroughly, fill dents with wood filler, and spot-prime problem areas. This
        foundation work can add 1 to 2 days and $500 to $1,000 to the total — but it is
        what separates a finish that lasts from one that chips in a year.
      </p>

      <h3>Kitchen Island</h3>

      <p>
        Islands add 6 to 12 doors plus panels that need finishing. Expect an additional
        $800 to $1,500 for a standard island with panels on one or both sides.
      </p>

      <h2>What a Proper Quote Includes</h2>

      <p>
        A complete fine-finish cabinet painting quote in Vancouver should include all of
        the following. If any of these are missing, it is a sign the painter may not have
        the process or equipment to deliver a lasting result.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Removal of all doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Cleaning and degreasing of all surfaces</li>
        <li>Hand sanding and scuffing for proper adhesion</li>
        <li>Bonding primer on all surfaces (not just topcoat)</li>
        <li>2 coats of HVLP spray-applied finish</li>
        <li>Painting of all visible cabinet frames</li>
        <li>Precise reinstallation of doors and hardware</li>
        <li>Touch-ups after installation</li>
        <li>Full floor and countertop protection</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Some painters skip the primer coat to cut corners. Without a proper bonding
        primer, the finish will chip within 6 to 12 months — and you end up paying
        twice. This is what happens when you hire someone without the spray skill or
        the right materials. Always ask specifically what primer they use. BIN
        shellac-based and Stix bonding primer are the industry standards that
        professionals rely on.
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Details That Improve the Result</h2>

      <h3>Hardware Replacement</h3>

      <p>
        New knobs and pulls typically cost $3 to $15 per piece. A kitchen with 30 doors
        and drawers needs 30+ pieces. That is $90 to $450 for hardware alone. Many of
        our clients choose to upgrade hardware at the same time — the visual difference
        is striking.
      </p>

      <h3>Soft-Close Hinge Upgrades</h3>

      <p>
        If your hinges are older, this is the ideal time to upgrade to soft-close. Most
        painters can swap these during reinstallation for $5 to $12 per hinge. A full
        kitchen upgrade runs $150 to $400 and adds a modern feel to every door.
      </p>

      <h3>Interior Shelving</h3>

      <p>
        Standard cabinet painting covers exterior surfaces only. If you want the inside
        of your cabinets painted, that adds $500 to $1,200 depending on size. Clients
        with glass-front doors almost always include this for a clean, finished look.
      </p>

      <h3>Crown Moulding or Trim</h3>

      <p>
        If your cabinets have crown moulding, light valances, or decorative trim, these
        need the same level of finish. Expect an additional $200 to $600 depending on
        complexity.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Ensure a Superior Result</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Get 3 quotes from spray-only painters — anyone offering brush-and-roller on cabinets lacks the equipment for a fine finish</li>
        <li>Ask to see photos of completed kitchens, not mid-project shots</li>
        <li>Confirm the quote includes bonding primer, not just topcoat</li>
        <li>Choose your colour before the estimate so the painter can plan for primer needs</li>
        <li>Bundle hardware replacement into your project for a complete transformation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Investment Delivers</h2>

      <p>
        At $4,000 to $6,000 for an average kitchen, a professional cabinet transformation
        is one of the highest-ROI home improvements you can make. Real estate data shows
        kitchen updates recoup 75% to 100% of their cost at resale. The investment is
        less than full cabinet replacement — and the finish quality from a master sprayer
        with HVLP equipment, bonding primers, and multiple precision coats is often
        superior to factory.
