      <p>
        Kitchen cabinet painting in Vancouver costs between $2,500 and $9,000 in 2026.
        The exact price depends on your kitchen size, the number of doors, the type of
        finish, and the condition of your existing cabinets. This guide breaks down
        real pricing so you know exactly what to expect before you call for a quote.
      </p>

      <h2>Cost by Kitchen Size</h2>

      <h3>Small Kitchen (15 to 25 Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        A small galley or condo kitchen with 15 to 25 doors and drawer fronts typically
        runs $2,500 to $4,000. This includes removal, cleaning, sanding, priming, 2 coats
        of spray-applied finish, and reinstallation. Most small kitchens take 3 days.
      </p>

      <h3>Medium Kitchen (25 to 40 Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        The average Vancouver kitchen falls here. Expect $4,000 to $6,000 for a full
        spray finish on all doors, drawer fronts, and cabinet frames. This is the most
        common range we quote. Plan for 4 days of work.
      </p>

      <h3>Large Kitchen (40 to 60+ Doors)</h3>

      <p>
        Large kitchens with islands, pantries, and butler stations run $6,000 to $9,000.
        Some luxury homes in Vancouver with 70+ doors can reach $10,000 to $12,000. These
        projects take 5 to 7 working days.
      </p>

      <h2>What Affects Your Price</h2>

      <h3>Number of Doors and Drawer Fronts</h3>

      <p>
        This is the biggest cost driver. Each door needs to be removed, labelled, cleaned,
        sanded, primed, and sprayed with 2 finish coats. More doors means more labour and
        more material. A kitchen with 40 doors costs roughly double a kitchen with 20.
      </p>

      <h3>Colour Change</h3>

      <p>
        Going from dark stained wood to white or light grey requires extra prep. The
        existing finish needs heavier sanding. You may need a coat of shellac-based
        primer to block tannin bleed. That adds $300 to $800 to the total.
      </p>

      <h3>Finish Type</h3>

      <p>
        A standard spray finish with a product like Benjamin Moore Advance costs less than
        a catalyzed lacquer or conversion varnish. High-performance finishes add $500 to
        $1,500 but offer better durability for high-traffic kitchens. For help choosing
        the right product, check our guide on{" "}

        .
      </p>

      <h3>Cabinet Condition</h3>

      <p>
        Cabinets with peeling laminate, grease buildup, or minor damage need extra prep.
        A professional crew will degrease with TSP, sand thoroughly, fill dents with wood
        filler, and spot-prime problem areas. Rough cabinets can add 1 to 2 days of prep
        time and $500 to $1,000 to the total.
      </p>

      <h3>Kitchen Island</h3>

      <p>
        Islands add 6 to 12 doors plus panels that need finishing. Budget an extra $800 to
        $1,500 for a standard island with panels on one or both sides.
      </p>

      <h2>What Should Be Included in Your Quote</h2>

      <p>
        A complete cabinet painting quote in Vancouver should include all of the following.
        If any of these are missing, ask why.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Removal of all doors, drawer fronts, and hardware</li>
        <li>Cleaning and degreasing of all surfaces</li>
        <li>Sanding and scuffing for adhesion</li>
        <li>Primer on all surfaces (not just topcoat)</li>
        <li>2 coats of spray-applied finish</li>
        <li>Painting of all visible cabinet frames</li>
        <li>Reinstallation of doors and hardware</li>
        <li>Touch-ups after installation</li>
        <li>Floor and countertop protection</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Some painters skip the primer coat to save time. That is a red flag. Without
        proper primer, the finish will chip within 6 to 12 months. Ask your painter
        specifically what primer they use. BIN shellac-based and Stix bonding primer
        are the industry standards.
      </p>

      <h2>Hidden Costs to Watch For</h2>

      <h3>Hardware Replacement</h3>

      <p>
        New knobs and pulls typically cost $3 to $15 per piece. A kitchen with 30 doors
        and drawers needs 30+ pieces. That is $90 to $450 just for hardware. Some
        homeowners spend more on premium hardware than on smaller add-on items.
      </p>

      <h3>Soft-Close Hinge Upgrades</h3>

      <p>
        If your hinges are older, now is the perfect time to upgrade to soft-close. Most
        painters can swap these during reinstallation for $5 to $12 per hinge. A full
        kitchen upgrade runs $150 to $400.
      </p>

      <h3>Interior Shelving</h3>

      <p>
        Standard cabinet painting covers exterior surfaces only. If you want the inside of
        your cabinets painted, that adds $500 to $1,200 depending on size. Most homeowners
        skip this unless they have glass-front doors.
      </p>

      <h3>Crown Moulding or Trim</h3>

      <p>
        If your cabinets have crown moulding, light valances, or decorative trim, these
        need painting too. Budget an extra $200 to $600 depending on complexity.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Get the Best Value</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Get 3 quotes from spray-only painters (skip anyone offering brush-and-roller on cabinets)</li>
        <li>Ask to see photos of finished kitchens, not mid-project shots</li>
        <li>Confirm the quote includes primer, not just topcoat</li>
        <li>Choose your colour before the estimate so the painter can plan for primer needs</li>
        <li>Bundle hardware replacement into your project to avoid a second disruption</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is It Worth the Investment?</h2>

      <p>
        At $4,000 to $6,000 for an average kitchen, cabinet painting is one of the highest
        ROI home improvements you can make. Real estate data shows kitchen updates recoup
        75% to 100% of their cost at resale. And you get a kitchen that feels completely
        new for a fraction of what full replacement costs.
