      <p>
        Knowing how to prepare for interior painting ensures a smoother project and a better result. A
        well-prepped home means the crew can start painting on day one instead of spending
        half the morning moving furniture and patching holes. Most painting projects go 20%
        to 30% faster when the homeowner handles basic preparation ahead of time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guide covers everything you need to do before your painting crew arrives. Follow
        this checklist and your project will run smoother from start to finish.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Move Out of the Rooms</h2>

      <p>
        Clear small furniture, wall decor, electronics, fragile items, curtains, and bedding from rooms being painted before the crew arrives. The more you remove, the faster and cleaner the paint job goes — most Vancouver homeowners can clear a room in under 30 minutes by working through this checklist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Start by clearing as much as possible from the rooms being painted. The more you
        remove, the faster and cleaner the job goes.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Small furniture: side tables, lamps, chairs, ottomans, and plant stands</li>
        <li>Wall decor: pictures, mirrors, shelves, and clocks</li>
        <li>Electronics: TVs, speakers, gaming consoles, and chargers</li>
        <li>Fragile items: vases, collectibles, and anything breakable</li>
        <li>Curtains and blinds: remove or tie them up out of the way</li>
        <li>Bedding and pillows: strip beds in rooms being painted</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Large furniture like sofas, beds, and dressers can stay in the room. Professional
        painters will move them to the center and cover them with plastic sheeting. But if
        you can move them yourself, it gives the crew unobstructed access to every
        surface from the start — which means cleaner lines and faster turnaround.
      </p>

      <h2>Wall Prep: What to Check Before the Crew Arrives</h2>

      <p>
        Walk through every room before your painting crew arrives and note nail holes, dents, cracks, nail pops, peeling paint, and water stains. You do not need to fix these yourself — a professional painter handles all repairs during the prep phase — but identifying them early helps you discuss the scope and avoid surprises on the quote.
      </p>

      <p>
        Walk through every room and look at the walls closely. Note anything that needs
        attention:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Nail holes from picture hangers</li>
        <li>Small dents or dings from furniture</li>
        <li>Hairline cracks along corners or around door frames</li>
        <li>Nail pops where drywall screws have pushed through the surface</li>
        <li>Peeling or flaking paint around windows, baseboards, or ceilings</li>
        <li>Water stains or discolouration</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You do not need to fix these yourself. A professional painter handles all of this
        during the prep phase. But knowing what is there helps you discuss the scope with
        your painter and avoid surprises on the quote.

        If your walls have significant imperfections and you want a perfectly smooth result,
        your painter may recommend a skim coat. Learn more about{" "}

      <h2>What Professional Painters Handle vs. What You Should Do</h2>

      <p>
        Professional painters handle all surface preparation, priming, masking, floor protection, and cleanup. You should handle clearing personal items, removing wall decor, taking down curtains, ensuring access, finalizing colours, and notifying neighbours. This division of labour is how Shape of Paint keeps Vancouver projects running on schedule.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Painter Handles</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Filling nail holes and dents with DAP DryDex spackle (it goes on pink and dries white so we never miss a spot)</li>
        <li>Sanding patched areas to 150 grit until smooth to the touch</li>
        <li>Caulking gaps between trim and walls with DAP Alex Flex</li>
        <li>Priming stains with BIN shellac primer, priming repaired areas and colour changes with Zinsser 1-2-3</li>
        <li>Masking trim, fixtures, and edges with FrogTape for clean, sharp lines</li>
        <li>Laying canvas drop cloths over floors and plastic sheeting over remaining furniture</li>
        <li>Cleaning up all materials and debris when the job is done</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>You Should Handle</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Clearing small furniture and personal items from the rooms</li>
        <li>Removing wall decor and filling in anchors (or leaving them for the crew)</li>
        <li>Taking down curtains if possible</li>
        <li>Ensuring the crew has clear access to all rooms and a path for equipment</li>
        <li>Deciding on final paint colours before the start date</li>
        <li>Letting neighbours know if the crew needs to park nearby</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Protecting Floors and Furniture</h2>

      <p>
        Professional painters protect your floors with 12-ounce canvas drop cloths and cover furniture with plastic sheeting. Canvas drops are heavier than cheap alternatives, so they stay in place and absorb drips instead of letting paint pool on your hardwood or carpet. Shape of Paint uses FrogTape on all baseboards, switches, and outlet covers for clean edge protection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any professional crew brings their own drop cloths and plastic sheeting. We use
        12-ounce canvas drop cloths on floors. They are heavier than the cheap ones, so they
        stay in place and absorb drips instead of letting them pool. Plastic covers large
        furniture pieces. FrogTape protects baseboards, light switches, and outlet covers.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have hardwood floors, ask your painter to use canvas drops instead of plastic
        on the floor. Plastic can be slippery and traps moisture underneath. Canvas absorbs
        drips and stays in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        For rooms with carpet, painters typically use a combination of plastic sheeting with
        canvas drops on top. Any drips soak into the canvas instead of seeping through to the
        carpet below.
      </p>

      <h2>Planning Around Kids and Pets</h2>

      <p>
        Keep children out of rooms being painted, set up a safe zone in an unpainted room, board pets or confine them to a separate area, move bird cages far from the painting area, and plan meals in advance if the kitchen is on the schedule. According to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), proper ventilation and room isolation during interior painting are especially important in homes with young children and pets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Painting day is not the best day for curious toddlers and excited dogs. Here is how
        to plan:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Keep kids out of rooms being painted. Even low-VOC paint is best avoided by
        young children until it dries.</li>
        <li>Set up a "safe zone" in a room that is not on the painting schedule. Stock it
        with snacks, toys, and entertainment.</li>
        <li>Board pets or keep them in a separate area of the house. Dogs and cats will walk
        through wet paint if given the chance. They will track it across your floors.</li>
        <li>Birds are extremely sensitive to airborne chemicals. Move any bird cages to a
        well-ventilated room far from the painting area.</li>
        <li>Plan meals in advance. If the kitchen is being painted, you will not have access
        to countertops for a day or two.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Timeline Expectations</h2>

      <p>
        A professional crew of 2 to 3 painters completes a single room in 1 day, a full condo in 2 to 3 days, and a full house interior in 3 to 5 days. Add 1 to 2 days for significant wall repair, skim coating, wallpaper removal, or dark-to-light colour changes that require tinted primer plus two topcoats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is how long different interior painting projects typically take with a
        professional crew of 2 to 3 painters:
      </p>

      <div className="overflow-x-auto">
        <table className="w-full border-collapse text-lg">
          <thead>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Project Size</th>
              <th className="py-3 pr-6 text-left font-medium text-foreground">Timeline</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody className="text-text-secondary">
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Single room (bedroom or office)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">1 day</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Two to three rooms</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">1 to 2 days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Full condo or apartment (700-1,000 sq ft)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">2 to 3 days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Full house interior (1,500-2,500 sq ft)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">3 to 5 days</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Large home with detailed trim (3,000+ sq ft)</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">5 to 8 days</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Add 1 to 2 days if the walls need significant repair, skim coating, or wallpaper
        removal. Colour changes from dark to light also add time because they require a coat
        of tinted primer plus two topcoats. We use Sherwin-Williams PVA primer tinted to 50%
        of the final colour. That cuts through even the darkest existing paint and gives the
        topcoat a clean base to work with. According to Sherwin-Williams, tinting primer to approximately 50% of the finish colour reduces the number of topcoats needed from three to two on most dark-to-light transitions.
      </p>

      <h2>Questions to Ask Your Painter Before They Start</h2>

      <p>
        A 10-minute conversation before the job starts prevents misunderstandings about coats, materials, prep, timeline, and warranty. Shape of Paint answers all 10 of these questions in writing as part of every project estimate for Vancouver homeowners.
      </p>

      <p>
        A 10-minute conversation before the job starts prevents misunderstandings later. Here
        are the questions that matter:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>How many coats of paint are included in the quote?</li>
        <li>What brand and product line of paint are you using?</li>
        <li>Is primer included, and where will it be applied?</li>
        <li>What prep work is included in the price?</li>
        <li>How long will the project take from start to finish?</li>
        <li>What time does the crew arrive and leave each day?</li>
        <li>Do I need to be home during the work?</li>
        <li>What is your warranty on workmanship?</li>
        <li>How do you handle touch-ups after the job is complete?</li>
        <li>Will you move furniture back when you are done?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        A reputable painter answers all of these confidently and puts it in writing. If
        someone is vague about prep work or the number of coats, that is a red flag.
      </p>
