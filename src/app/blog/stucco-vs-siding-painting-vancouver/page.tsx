      <p>
        Stucco painting in Vancouver is a completely different job than
        painting wood or fibre cement siding. Different prep. Different
        primers. Different paint products. Different failure modes. If your
        painter treats them the same way, you will see problems within 2 to 3
        years. About 40% of homes in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland have
        stucco. Another 35% have some form of wood or engineered siding. The
        rest are a mix of vinyl, aluminum, and Hardie board.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is exactly how the process differs for each surface — and the
        mistakes that cause most paint failures on Vancouver homes.
      </p>

      <h2>Painting Stucco in Vancouver</h2>

      <p>
        Painting stucco in Vancouver requires crack repair, low-pressure
        washing, a masonry-specific or elastomeric primer, and either an
        elastomeric coating or premium 100% acrylic latex topcoat. Shape
        of Paint uses this exact sequence on every stucco home across the
        Lower Mainland.
      </p>

      <h3>Prep: Crack Repair Comes First</h3>

      <p>
        Stucco cracks. It is porous, rigid, and expands and contracts with
        temperature changes. In Vancouver, water freezing in hairline cracks
        during winter widens them year after year. Before any paint goes on,
        every crack needs to be addressed.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Hairline cracks (under 1 mm):</strong> An elastomeric
          primer or coating will bridge these. No filler needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Small cracks (1 to 3 mm):</strong> Fill with a flexible
          elastomeric caulk or patching compound. Rigid fillers will crack
          again within a year.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Large cracks or missing chunks:</strong> Patch with a
          stucco repair compound. Feather the edges to match the surrounding
          texture. Prime the patch separately before topcoating.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After repairs, the entire surface gets pressure-washed at low
        pressure (1,500 to 2,000 PSI max — higher pressure damages stucco).
        Then it needs 48 to 72 hours to dry completely before priming.
      </p>

      <h3>Primer: Elastomeric or Masonry-Specific</h3>

      <p>
        Standard latex primer does not bond well to stucco. You need a
        masonry-specific bonding primer that penetrates the porous surface.
        For stucco with recurring cracks, an elastomeric primer creates a
        flexible base layer that stretches with the wall.
      </p>

      <h3>Paint: Elastomeric Coatings Win</h3>

      <p>
        For stucco in Vancouver, elastomeric coatings are the gold standard.
        They stretch up to 300%, bridge hairline cracks, and create a
        waterproof membrane. They cost more ($90 to $120 per gallon vs. $75
        to $95 for standard premium paint) but last 15 to 20 years instead
        of 7 to 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        For stucco in good condition with no recurring cracks, a high-quality 100% acrylic latex in flat or
        satin sheen works well on stucco that is in good condition with no
        recurring crack problems.
      </p>

      <h2>Painting Wood Siding in Vancouver</h2>

      <p>
        Painting wood siding in Vancouver starts with a thorough rot
        inspection, followed by scraping, sanding, caulking, and
        tannin-blocking primer on all bare wood. Two coats of premium
        acrylic latex in satin or semi-gloss finish complete the system.
      </p>

      <h3>Prep: Scrape, Sand, and Check for Rot</h3>

      <p>
        Wood siding prep starts with a thorough inspection. Every board gets
        checked for rot, especially at the bottom 12 inches where splash-back
        from rain keeps wood wet. Rotten boards must be replaced before
        painting. Painting over rot is a waste of money — the paint will fail
        within a year.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Scrape all loose, peeling, and flaking paint</li>
        <li>Sand rough edges and feather scraped areas</li>
        <li>Set and fill any protruding nail heads</li>
        <li>Caulk gaps between boards, around windows, and at joints</li>
        <li>Prime bare wood and repaired areas with a wood primer</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Primer: Wood-Specific Formulas</h3>

      <p>
        Bare cedar and other softwoods bleed tannins — those brown stains
        that bleed through fresh paint. A stain-blocking primer (oil-based
        like Zinsser Cover Stain or shellac-based like BIN) seals tannins
        and prevents bleed-through. Latex primers alone cannot block tannins
        on cedar.
      </p>

      <h3>Paint: Premium Acrylic Latex</h3>

      <p>
        Two coats of 100% acrylic latex in satin or semi-gloss. Satin is the
        most popular choice for wood siding bodies. Semi-gloss goes on trim,
        fascia, and window frames. Both sheens shed water well and resist
        mildew. The cost question comes up for every surface — see our{" "}

      </p>

      <h2>Painting Hardie Board (Fibre Cement)</h2>

      <p>
        Hardie board (fibre cement) is the easiest exterior surface to
        paint in Vancouver. It does not rot or bleed tannins, requires
        minimal prep, and holds premium acrylic latex coatings for 12 to
        15 years with proper caulk maintenance at all board joints.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hardie board is one of the easiest surfaces to paint. It does not
        rot, does not bleed tannins, and holds paint extremely well. Prep is
        straightforward: clean, spot-prime any bare areas where factory
        primer has worn off, and apply two coats of premium acrylic latex.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main thing to watch with Hardie board is caulk joints. If the
        caulking between boards has cracked or pulled away, moisture gets
        behind the panels. Re-caulk all joints with a 25-year exterior
        sealant before painting.
      </p>

      <h2>Painting Vinyl Siding</h2>

      <p>
        Vinyl siding can be painted, but only with vinyl-safe formulations
        like Sherwin-Williams VinylSafe colours. The key rule is never
        going darker than the original colour, since darker shades absorb
        more heat and can warp the panels on Vancouver&apos;s sun-exposed
        walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, you can paint vinyl siding. No, you cannot use just any paint.
        Vinyl expands and contracts significantly with temperature changes. A
        standard exterior paint on vinyl will crack and peel.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use a paint specifically formulated for vinyl siding (like
        Sherwin-Williams VinylSafe or Benjamin Moore&apos;s vinyl-safe
        colours). According to Sherwin-Williams, their VinylSafe colour
        palette is engineered to reflect enough heat to prevent warping
        on vinyl substrates, even in direct sun exposure. These paints
        flex with the siding. Important rule: never
        paint vinyl a colour darker than the original. Darker colours absorb
        more heat, which can warp the panels.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes That Cause Failure</h2>

      <p>
        The five most common exterior paint failures in Vancouver are
        wrong primer selection, skipping stucco crack repairs, painting
        over rot, pressure washing stucco at full blast, and painting wet
        surfaces. Each one leads to premature coating failure within 1 to
        3 years.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Using the wrong primer.</strong> Latex primer on cedar
          bleeds through. Standard primer on stucco peels. Masonry primer on
          wood wastes money. Match the primer to the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Skipping crack repairs on stucco.</strong> Paint does not
          fill cracks. Water gets behind paint through unfilled cracks and
          causes widespread failure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Painting over rot.</strong> Rotten wood does not hold
          paint. Replace it first. A $200 board replacement prevents a $2,000
          repaint.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pressure washing stucco at full blast.</strong> Stucco is
          softer than it looks. Anything over 2,000 PSI gouges the surface
          and creates weak spots.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Painting wet surfaces.</strong> Stucco needs 48 to 72
          hours to dry after washing. Wood needs 24 to 48 hours. Painting
          over residual moisture traps it under the film.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        Stucco and wood siding require completely different prep, primers,
        and topcoats. According to the National Research Council Canada,
        matching coating systems to substrate type is critical for
        long-term building envelope performance in high-moisture climates
        like coastal BC.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stucco and siding are different materials that need different
        approaches. Stucco requires elastomeric products, crack repair, and
        gentle pressure washing. Wood siding needs rot checks, tannin-blocking
        primer, and thorough scraping. Hardie board is the easiest. Vinyl
        needs specialized paint. A painter who understands these differences
        will give you a finish that lasts 10 to 15 years instead of 3 to 5.
