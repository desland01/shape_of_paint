      <p>
        Cabinet painting vs replacing is the first question every Vancouver
        homeowner asks when their kitchen starts looking tired. Most people
        assume new cabinets automatically look better. After spraying hundreds
        of kitchens, I can tell you they do not. A master spray finish on solid
        existing cabinets delivers a smoother, more uniform, more customizable
        result than anything that comes off a factory line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a side-by-side breakdown covering finish quality, cost,
        timeline, and disruption so you can decide which path is right for your
        home.
      </p>

      <h2>The Finish Quality Nobody Talks About</h2>

      <p>
        Professional cabinet painting in Vancouver delivers a hand-sprayed HVLP finish
        that outperforms factory coatings on smoothness, sheen consistency, and colour
        accuracy. Shape of Paint uses controlled spray setups to build thin, even coats
        that cure to a glass-smooth surface with zero orange peel texture.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you buy replacement cabinets — even expensive ones — you get a
        factory-applied finish. That means automated spray lines, standard
        sheen levels, and whatever colours the manufacturer stocks. Walk through
        any showroom and you will see the same 12 finishes on every door.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we spray your existing cabinets, you choose any colour from any
        manufacturer. Benjamin Moore, Sherwin-Williams, Farrow &amp; Ball —
        whatever matches your design vision. We apply it in a controlled setup
        with HVLP spray equipment, building up thin, even coats that cure to a
        glass-smooth surface.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have seen $40,000 custom kitchens that do not look as good as what we
        spray in a week. That is not marketing talk. Factory finishes show
        orange peel texture, inconsistent sheen, and visible edge buildup. A
        hand-sprayed finish by someone who knows what they are doing does not
        have those flaws.
      </p>

      <h2>What the Numbers Look Like</h2>

      <p>
        Cabinet painting in Vancouver typically costs $3,000 to $6,000 for a standard
        kitchen, while full cabinet replacement runs $15,000 to $40,000. Shape of Paint
        projects include cleaning, sanding, bonding primer, and 2 coats of HVLP
        spray-applied finish on all doors, drawer fronts, and frames.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professional cabinet painting in Vancouver typically costs between
        $3,000 and $6,000 for an average-sized kitchen. That includes cleaning,
        sanding, priming, and 2 coats of spray-applied finish on all doors,
        drawer fronts, and frames.
      </p>

      <p>
        Replacing those same cabinets runs $15,000 to $30,000. That covers
        demolition, new boxes, new doors, hardware, countertop adjustments,
        plumbing reconnection, and installation labour. Some custom kitchens in
        Vancouver exceed $40,000.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to CMHC (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation), minor kitchen
        renovations like cabinet refinishing recoup 75% to 100% of the investment at
        resale — making it one of the highest-ROI home improvements in the Canadian
        housing market.
      </p>

      <p>
        The investment difference is significant. But the reason to refinish is
        not the lower price tag — it is the superior finish. A skilled spray
        application with premium paint outperforms factory-applied coatings on
        colour accuracy, surface smoothness, and sheen consistency. The fact
        that it costs less is a bonus. Want a detailed cost breakdown by kitchen

      <h2>Timeline: 3 to 5 Days vs. 4 to 8 Weeks</h2>

      <p>
        Professional cabinet painting takes 3 to 5 working days for an average Vancouver
        kitchen. Full cabinet replacement requires 4 to 8 weeks from order to completion,
        with custom cabinets adding 10 to 14 weeks for fabrication alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        A professional cabinet painting crew finishes most Vancouver kitchens
        in 3 to 5 working days. Doors and drawer fronts come off on day one.
        They get cleaned, sanded, primed, and spray-finished in a controlled
        setup. Frames are prepped and painted on-site. Everything goes back
        together by the end of the week.
      </p>

      <p>
        A full cabinet replacement takes 4 to 8 weeks from the day you order.
        Custom cabinets in Vancouver can take 10 to 14 weeks for fabrication
        alone. Then you need another 1 to 2 weeks for demolition and
        installation. If countertops need adjusting, add another week.
      </p>

      <p>
        That is a big difference when you are trying to cook dinner for your
        family.
      </p>

      <h2>Disruption Level</h2>

      <p>
        Cabinet painting causes minimal disruption to your Vancouver home — you keep
        access to your sink, stove, and fridge throughout the 3-to-5-day process. Full
        replacement turns your kitchen into a construction zone for weeks.
      </p>

      <p>
        With painting, you lose access to your cabinets for 3 to 5 days. You
        can still use your sink, stove, and fridge. Most families set up a
        temporary station on the dining table and barely notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a full replacement, your kitchen is a construction zone. No
        countertops. No cabinets. Plumbing disconnected. Dust everywhere. You
        are eating takeout for weeks. If you have young kids, that gets old
        fast.
      </p>

      <h2>The Environmental Angle</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing cabinets in Vancouver generates near-zero waste compared to
        replacement, which sends hundreds of pounds of wood, MDF, and laminate to the
        landfill. Construction and demolition waste accounts for roughly 30% of Metro
        Vancouver landfill volume each year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Replacing cabinets sends hundreds of pounds of wood, MDF, and laminate
        to the landfill. In Metro Vancouver alone, construction and demolition
        waste accounts for roughly 30% of all material going to the dump each
        year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Painting keeps your existing boxes in place. You generate almost zero
        waste. The only materials used are primer, paint, and a small amount of
        sandpaper. If your cabinets are structurally solid, there is no reason
        to throw them away.
      </p>

      <h2>When Refinishing Is the Right Choice</h2>

      <p>
        Refinishing is the right choice for about 85% of Vancouver kitchens — any home
        where the cabinet boxes are structurally solid and the layout works. Shape of
        Paint sees this in most kitchens built in the last 30 years.

            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">You want exact colour and sheen control</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Yes</td>

              <td className="py-3 pr-6">You need the project done in under a week</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr className="border-b border-border-subtle">
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">You like your current kitchen layout</td>
              <td className="py-3 pr-6">Yes</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        That describes about 85% of the kitchens we see in Vancouver. Most
        cabinets built in the last 30 years have solid plywood or MDF boxes
        that hold up fine. It is the finish that ages — and the finish is
        exactly what we replace.
      </p>

      <h2>When Replacing Makes More Sense</h2>

      <p>
        Full cabinet replacement is the right call when boxes are structurally
        compromised — warped, water-damaged, or delaminating — or when you need a
        completely new kitchen layout with different plumbing and electrical.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Cabinet boxes are warped, water-damaged, or delaminating
        </li>
        <li>You want to change the kitchen layout entirely</li>
        <li>Shelves are sagging and cannot be repaired</li>
        <li>
          You are doing a full gut renovation with new plumbing and electrical
        </li>
        <li>
          Door styles are deeply recessed and dated beyond what paint can fix
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If any of those apply, replacement is the right call. But be honest
        with yourself. If the bones are good, a professional spray finish
        delivers a result that looks and feels better than off-the-shelf
        replacements — because it is built to your exact specification.
      </p>

      <h2>What About Refacing?</h2>

      <p>
        Refacing is a middle option between painting and replacing — you keep
        the boxes but get new doors, typically costing $8,000 to $15,000 in
        Vancouver. For most homeowners, a spray refinish still delivers a
        smoother, more customizable result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Refacing sits between painting and replacing. You keep the boxes but
        replace the doors and drawer fronts with new ones. Cost runs $8,000 to
        $15,000 in Vancouver. It makes sense if your doors are physically
        damaged but your frames are fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        For most homeowners, a spray refinish still delivers the better result.
        A hand-finished cabinet door has a smoother, more uniform surface than
        a factory-produced replacement — and you choose the exact colour and
        sheen instead of picking from a catalogue.
      </p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>
        For Vancouver homeowners with structurally sound cabinets, a master HVLP spray
        refinish delivers the highest-quality kitchen finish available — better than
        factory, faster than replacement, and with zero waste sent to the landfill.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your cabinet boxes are in good shape, a master spray refinish is the
        highest-quality finish you can put on your kitchen. You get a
        hand-applied surface that outperforms factory coatings. You get your
        kitchen back in less than a week. You keep perfectly good materials out
        of the landfill. And the investment runs well below what replacement
        costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Benjamin Moore, their Advance alkyd-modified formula delivers a
        furniture-grade finish that resists chipping and yellowing for 8 to 12 years
        when properly applied with HVLP spray equipment over a bonding primer.
