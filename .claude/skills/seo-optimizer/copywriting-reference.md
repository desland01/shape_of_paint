# Copywriting Reference — Shape of Paint

Alex Hormozi + Cody Sanchez conversion copywriting methodology applied to shapeofpaint.com. Use for any headline, CTA, meta description, page copy, or email.

## Value Equation

Every piece of copy must maximize this:

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay x Effort)
```

To increase value:
- Paint a BIGGER dream outcome (transformed home, not "painted walls")
- Increase perceived likelihood (proof, testimonials, guarantees)
- Decrease time to results ("finished in 3 days", not "soon")
- Decrease effort required ("you pick the colours, we handle the rest")

## Hook Formulas

### Hormozi Hook
```
"How to [OUTCOME] without [PAIN], even if [OBJECTION]"
```

Shape of Paint examples:
- "How to transform your kitchen for under $3,000 without a full renovation, even if your cabinets are 20 years old"
- "How to get a flawless exterior paint job without worrying about Vancouver rain ruining the finish"

### Sanchez Contrarian Hook
```
"Everyone says [common belief]. They're wrong. Here's why..."
```

Shape of Paint examples:
- "Everyone says you need to replace old cabinets. They're wrong. Here's why spray-finishing saves you thousands."
- "Most painters say exterior work can't happen in Vancouver's rainy season. We disagree."

### Specific Numbers
Always lead with SPECIFIC numbers for instant credibility:
- "We've painted 47 kitchens in Vancouver this year"
- "Save $8,000-$12,000 vs. cabinet replacement"
- "Your project finished in 3-5 days, not 3-5 weeks"

## Writing Rules

1. **5th grade reading level** — short words, short sentences
2. **"You" more than "we"** — make it about the homeowner, not us
3. **Short sentences. Like this.** — break up long thoughts
4. **Specific numbers always** — "47 families" not "many families"
5. **Damaging admissions build trust** — "We cost more than the cheapest painters. Here's why that saves you money."
6. **Start sentences with "And" or "But"** — conversational tone
7. **No jargon** — "prep work" not "surface preparation protocols"
8. **No hedging** — "will" not "might", "does" not "could"

## CTA Patterns

**Specific beats generic:**
- "Get Your Free Painting Estimate" (not "Submit")
- "See Our 47 Kitchen Transformations" (not "View Portfolio")
- "Call Gabe at 604-353-7378" (not "Contact Us")
- "Schedule My Free Colour Consultation" (not "Book Now")

**Conversational CTAs:**
- "Show me what my kitchen could look like"
- "Send me the free estimate"
- "I want the same finish"

**Qualifier CTAs (for premium positioning):**
- "This isn't for everyone. If you want a factory-smooth cabinet finish that lasts 10+ years, let's talk."

## Persuasion Techniques

### Damaging Admissions
Admit a weakness before they think of it:
- "We're not the cheapest painters in Vancouver. But our clients don't hire us to save money — they hire us because they don't want to do it twice."
- "We only take on 4-5 projects at a time. That means you might have to wait. But when we start, you get our full attention."

### Social Proof Stacking
Layer proof throughout the page:
1. **Aggregate rating** in hero: "4.9 stars on Google (127 reviews)"
2. **Text testimonials** mid-page with customer names
3. **Video testimonial** if available
4. **Before/after gallery** showing real Vancouver projects
5. **Trust badges** in footer: licensed, insured, BBB

### The "vs. Replacing" Frame (Cabinets)
Make the mundane feel like a smart financial move:
- "Your neighbours spent $25,000 on new cabinets. You'll spend $3,500 for the same look."
- "Same result. Fraction of the price. Zero demolition headache."

## Content Framework: Hook, Retain, Reward

### 1. Hook (first 3 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt or contrarian statement
- Specific number
- Create curiosity gap

### 2. Retain (middle)
- Deliver on the hook's promise
- Use the value equation
- Add proof throughout (testimonials, numbers, before/afters)

### 3. Reward (end)
- Give them a clear win or insight
- Unexpected value
- Clear, specific next step (CTA)

## Copywriting Checklist

Before publishing any copy:

- [ ] Does the hook create instant curiosity?
- [ ] Is there a contrarian angle or damaging admission?
- [ ] Have I used specific numbers (not vague claims)?
- [ ] Does it pass the Value Equation test?
- [ ] Is the CTA specific and unexpected?
- [ ] Would I actually read this? Be honest.
- [ ] Written at 5th grade level?
- [ ] Sounds like a human, not a brand?
- [ ] "You" appears more than "we"?
