# Reverse Silo Reference — Shape of Paint

Kyle Roof's Reverse Silo Technique applied to shapeofpaint.com. Supporting blog posts concentrate link equity on target service pages.

## How the Reverse Silo Works

```
[Supporting A]  [Supporting B]  [Supporting C]
       \              |              /
        └─────────────v─────────────┘
             [TARGET PAGE]
```

Link equity flows FROM supporting posts DOWN to the target page, concentrating ranking power where it matters most.

## Linking Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Every supporting post **MUST link to its TARGET PAGE**
2. Each supporting post links to **1-2 OTHER supporting posts** in the same silo
3. **NO daisy chaining** — if A links to B, A does NOT link to C through B
4. Supporting posts have **NO other outbound internal links** outside the silo

## Anchor Text Strategy for Silo Links

When linking from a supporting post to its target page, vary anchor text:

| Type | % | Interior Examples | Exterior Examples | Cabinet Examples |
|------|---|------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Exact | 15% | "interior painting vancouver" | "exterior painting vancouver" | "cabinet painting vancouver" |
| Partial | 30% | "our interior painting services" | "Vancouver exterior painters" | "professional cabinet painting" |
| Branded | 30% | "Shape of Paint" | "Gabe and his crew" | "Shape of Paint's team" |
| Generic | 20% | "learn more" | "our services" | "view details" |
| Long-tail | 5% | "interior painting services in Vancouver BC" | "exterior house painting across the Lower Mainland" | "spray-finished cabinet painting in Vancouver" |

## Blog Post Template

Every supporting post should follow this structure:

```
H1: [Post Title with Target Keyword]
├── H2: [Problem/Question Section]
├── H2: [Answer/Solution with Detail]
│   ├── H3: [Sub-point 1]
│   └── H3: [Sub-point 2]
├── H2: [Cost/Comparison/Data Section]
├── H2: What to Look for in a Vancouver Painter
│   └── [LINK TO TARGET PAGE here]
└── H2: Ready to Get Started?
    └── [CTA + LINK TO TARGET PAGE here]
```

- Minimum 800 words per post
- Target keyword in H1, first 100 words, and at least one H2
- Include 2-3 images with keyword-rich alt text
- Article schema markup on every blog post
- Link to target page must appear naturally in body content (not just the CTA)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Adding links outside the silo** — no links to homepage, about, other service pages
2. **Daisy chaining** — if Post 1 links to Post 2, Post 1 does NOT link to Post 3 through Post 2
3. **Forgetting the target page link** — every post MUST link to its silo's target page
4. **Too many outbound links** — max 3 internal links per post (1 target + 1-2 supporting)
5. **Duplicate content across posts** — each post must have a unique angle and keyword
