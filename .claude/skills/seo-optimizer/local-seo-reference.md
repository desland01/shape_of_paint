## Review Strategy

### Key Research Finding

**Reviews from *this month* matter more than total review count.** (Sterling Sky study: dental client with 60+ reviews/month dominated rankings. They stopped for 18 days — rankings fell off a cliff.)

### Targets

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Monthly new reviews | 10-15 minimum |
| Response rate | 100% (every review) |
| Response time | Within 24-48 hours |
| Rating floor | Maintain 4.0+ |

### Review Generation Process

1. Ask at the point of maximum satisfaction (walkthrough day)
2. Send direct Google review link via text/email
3. Follow up with non-responders after 3 days
4. Encourage written reviews mentioning specific service ("interior painting", "cabinet spray finish")
5. Ask happy customers to attach project photos
6. Never stop — gaps in review flow tank rankings

### Responding to Negative Reviews

1. Respond quickly (within 24-48 hours)
2. Thank them for the feedback
3. Acknowledge their concern specifically
4. Take the conversation offline
5. Offer to make it right
6. NEVER argue publicly or reveal private information

## "Near Me" Rankings

Sterling Sky's study of 8,186 businesses found:

1. **Show your address** if you have a qualifying one — businesses with visible addresses rank better for "near me" queries
2. **Recent reviews matter most** — review velocity beats total count
3. **Substantive landing page content** — more meaningful words (not filler) correlates with better rankings
4. **Reviews with text** have stronger ranking impact than star-only reviews
5. **Google uses review content** to understand what a business does — encourage customers to mention specific services

### What Does NOT Help "Near Me" Rankings
- Adding "near me" or "near you" to your website content does NOT help Local Pack rankings
- It can help organic rankings below the pack, but not the 3-pack itself
