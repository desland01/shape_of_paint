# Sterling Sky Local SEO (Joy Hawkins Methodology)

Research-backed local SEO strategies from Joy Hawkins and Sterling Sky, based on real data from thousands of businesses and Google Product Expert insights.

## About This Methodology

Joy Hawkins is the owner of Sterling Sky, Local Search Forum, and LocalU. She's been a Google Business Profile Product Expert since 2006 and has worked on thousands of local listings. This methodology is based on actual testing and research, not theory.

## "Near Me" Ranking Factors (8,186 Businesses Study)

Sterling Sky analyzed businesses across 200 cities (large, mid-sized, and small) for searches like "plumber near me", "HVAC near me", etc. Key findings:

### 1. Show Your Address (Critical)

**Finding:** Hiding your address negatively correlates with local pack rankings.

Google says service-area businesses should hide their address. But the data shows:
- Businesses with visible addresses rank better for "near me" searches
- Testing on real clients: hiding address = rankings tanked, showing address = rankings recovered

**Action:** If possible, have a real office with a real address. The map pin is critical for "near me" queries.

### 2. Review Rating Matters

Higher average ratings correlate with better rankings. But:
- One bad review won't destroy you
- Consistency over time matters more than a perfect 5.0
- If you're around 2.9 stars, that's hurting you

### 3. Real Content on Landing Pages

Correlation between more "non-stop words" (substantive content, not "the", "and", "a") and better rankings.

**Key insight:** More words ≠ better rankings. More *meaningful* words = better rankings.

### 4. Recent Reviews > Total Reviews

**Critical finding:** Reviews from *this month* matter more than your total review count.

Case study: Dental client with 60+ reviews/month dominated rankings. They stopped for 18 days → rankings fell off a cliff. Competitors getting 15-45 new reviews/month held steady.

**Action:** Keep reviews flowing in consistently. Don't let review generation stop.

### 5. Reviews With Text Have Stronger Impact

- Reviews with actual text have stronger ranking impact
- Google uses review content to understand what a business is about
- 1-star ratings *without* text don't even show on Google Maps app

**Action:** Encourage customers to write detailed reviews, not just click stars.

### 6. Photos (Industry Dependent)

- In visual-heavy industries (restaurants, salons): photos help
- In service industries (garage doors): minimal impact
- Having recent photos matters more than total photo count

## Google Business Profile Optimization

### Essential Setup (100% Completion)

- Primary + secondary categories (choose carefully)
- High-quality photos (exterior, interior, team, work samples)
- Keyword-rich business description
- All services/products with descriptions
- Enable messaging and Q&A
- Complete all attributes

### Ongoing Management

- Post weekly updates (offers, events, news)
- Respond to ALL reviews (positive and negative)
- Answer Q&A questions promptly
- Update hours for holidays
- Add new photos regularly

### Category Selection

Categories directly impact what searches you appear for. Tips:
- Primary category = your main service
- Add relevant secondary categories
- Monitor Google's category changes (they update frequently)
- Check sterlingsky.ca/google-my-business-category-changes/ for updates

## Service Area Business (SAB) Best Practices

For businesses that travel to customers (plumbers, painters, etc.):

### The Address Dilemma

Google's guidance says to hide your address. But research shows showing it helps rankings.

**Options:**
1. **Have a real office** - Best for rankings
2. **Use a qualifying address** - Must be staffed during business hours
3. **Hide address (Google-compliant)** - May hurt "near me" rankings

**Warning:** Virtual offices and co-working spaces often don't qualify. Google may suspend listings using non-qualifying addresses.

### Service Area Settings

- Define your service areas (cities, zip codes, or radius)
- Don't set areas you don't actually serve
- Be realistic about your actual service range

## Review Management

### Generating Reviews Consistently

The key is *consistency*, not volume spikes:
- Build review requests into your workflow
- Ask at the point of maximum satisfaction
- Make it easy (direct link to leave review)
- Follow up with non-responders

### Handling Negative Reviews

**Response framework:**
1. Respond quickly (within 24-48 hours)
2. Thank them for feedback
3. Acknowledge their concern
4. Take conversation offline if needed
5. Offer to make it right

**Never:**
- Argue publicly
- Reveal private information
- Ignore negative reviews

### Fighting Fake Reviews

If you receive fake reviews:
1. Flag through GBP dashboard
2. Report to Google support
3. Document evidence
4. Consider legal action for repeat offenders

**"Review Jail":** Google sometimes restricts your ability to get new reviews if they detect review manipulation. Avoid:
- Review gating (only asking happy customers)
- Incentivized reviews
- Review exchanges

## Local Pack vs. Organic Rankings

Different strategies for each:

### Local Pack (3-Pack)
- GBP optimization is primary
- Proximity to searcher matters heavily
- Reviews and ratings are ranking factors
- "Near me" content on website doesn't help local pack

### Organic (Below the Pack)
- Traditional SEO signals matter
- Adding "near you" to content helps organic
- Service area pages work well
- Content quality and relevance

## 2025/2026 Local SEO Threats

### 1. Declining Organic Visibility
- AI Overviews eating organic clicks
- More ad space in local results
- Local Services Ads (LSA) expanding

### 2. AI's Impact on Search
- ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini changing how people search
- Need to optimize for AI platforms, not just Google
- Video content becoming more important

### 3. Review Attacks
- Competitors and bad actors leaving fake negative reviews
- Google's response system is slow
- Build review velocity to withstand attacks
